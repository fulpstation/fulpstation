				<li class="balance">ID cards have now completely changed. ID cards have limited available access slots increased by card rarity and the specific job trim. Jobs with more innate access now have more valuable ID cards. Better watch your backs!</li>
				<li class="balance">Yes, this means that you can no longer mass-distribute unrestricted All Access. During War Ops, you're expected to protect the diskie and disk holder. Sec can distribute guns. Cargo can order guns. You can still get key accesses like Maint on any ID card. HoP can still create and trim special silver ID cards for high value staff members to get more access. Adapt. Overcome. Suffer.</li>
				<li class="balance">Chameleon ID cards are completely reworked. Instead of copying all accesses from a card, they now open up an interface where you can select up to 5 accesses to copy over depending on the target card's access. tweak: The ID Console has been updated to reflect these new changes including a somewhat improved layout. You can apply job templates direct to cards via a drop-down interface and these templates will attempt to fill out as many accesses on the card as it can based on the card's trim and the template's wildcard setup. tweak: The PDA Painter has now been upgraded with a tgui interface. It can be used to paint PDAs the same as before, but can now also change the trim on ID cards. This procedure will remove all access levels from the ID card in the process, leaving you with a freshly trimmed blank ID card. tweak: Captain job trims now have a white star instead of a dull grey star. removed: Mining Conscript Card has been removed and replaced with a spare mining ID that holds and has the access the Conscript card gave. tweak: The Captain's Spare ID has been moved from the Captain's locker to a secure safe on the bridge. The highest ranking Command member on shift start is given the codes to this safe, generally following the chain of command. The QM is part of this and can, in exceptional circumstances where no other heads join the shift, become Acting Captain. Their ID card would be given Bridge access if they were picked as Acting Captain to allow them to access the captain's spare. If nobody in the chain of command joins the shift, the next latejoined player from the chain of command will be given the codes for the spare and promoted to Acting Captain automatically. tweak: The secure safe on the bridge is a special variant that is immune to conventional weaponry and lacks the hacking mechanic of ordinary wall safes. Maybe if you could examine it close enough, you'd find hints to its weaknesses... tweak: Examining players now shows a more detailed representation of any ID card in their ID slot.</li>

			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscadd">Adds a new reaction mechanic that allows reaction to occur in an incremental fashion. This uses temperature to determine reaction rate and pH to determine purity. The hotter it is, the faster it reacts. Keeping your pH within the range (default 5-9) will keep it pure, with the further out you are affecting your purity. Reactions are also H+ consuming/producing and exo/endothermic.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Adds purity mechanics for reactions - if a purity extremely low at the end of a reaction then it will convert into viscous sludge or a failed chem. When a reagent is consumed; If a reagent is very impure it will inverse into another chem. This inversion will remove all of the original chem and take its place instead. If it's slightly impure then it will split into an impure chem with respect to purity. The ratio of original to impure is determined by the purity of the original when consumed.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Adds the following basic impure reagents to accommodate the changes above: Chemical isomers, Toxic sludge and Viscous sludge.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Acidic and basic buffers. These will self-consume when added to a reagent holder will other reagents in it, and alter the pH towards their respective extreme. Thereby altering the pH without affecting the volume. adds; Optional catalysts - these reagents will speed up the reaction of a certain type. Presently Palladium synthate catalyst exists and works on medicine reagents only.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Competitive reactions - Tempomyocin and Purity tester are reactions that compete based off temperature. Tempomyocin is a reagent that will instantly speed up a reaction based off its purity and the purity tester reagent will fizzle if the solution it is added to has anything impure in it.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Adds an overheat/impure mechanic during reactions - overheating your reaction past it's overheat point will reduce the yield of your product by 2% per tick, with some reactions having special explosions instead. If overly impure it will reduce the purity of all reagents present in the beaker.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">1 dropper and 1 bottle of acidic buffer (you can make this) to the chemist's locker. Gives chemists a starting dropper and random buffer. Added pH booklets to the chemists chemdrobe - these can tell you the pH of a beaker by ripping a sheet out of them and using it on a beaker or reagent holder</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Adds a pH meter than can be researched and printed from the med lathe. When used on a reagent holder it will tell you a detailed breakdown of the reagents in the beaker, including pH, volume and purity. It will also detect ongoing reactions.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Adds pH to all reagents - the pH of a beaker/holder will be the sum of all reagents with respect to volume. pH is an abstracted potential of hydrogen that affects reactions.</li>
				<li class="tweak">heavily edited the chem heater into a reaction chamber, showing multiple details on a reaction, edited chem master and chem dispenser’s UI to show pH.</li>
				<li class="tweak">You can now use droppers and syringes directly on heaters to affect the beaker inside of it (provided there’s a beaker in there)</li>
				<li class="tweak">Tweaks most reagents to use a default handler. The ones omitted are ones that rely on being instant. This default has a minimum reaction temperature of 100, an optimal temperature of 500 and an overheat temperature of 900+. Their optimal pH range is 5-9; which will result in a purity 1 reagent when kept within this window. If the reaction is within a pH window of 1-4 or 9-13 the resulting purity will be dependent on the deviation from 5 or 9. <1 or >14 will create impure chems for every step. If your final purity on the end of a reaction is less than 0.15, then it will collapse into Viscous sludge. The reaction is mildly exothermic and H+ consuming.</li>
				<li class="tweak">tweaks chocolate milk, firefighting foam and hercuri reactions to work better with the new mechanics. These inherit the same pH windows as above but are cold reactions instead.</li>
				<li class="soundadd">added several sound effects for chemistry</li>
