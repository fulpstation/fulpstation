      non-sentient race of jellyfish-like organisms that float in the air and feed
      on the life energy of other organisms. While most Metroids have never shown
      signs of self-awareness, they do exhibit signs of basic logic and reasoning
      skills as well as very sophisticated perception. Nanotrasen has shipped two
      baby Metroids for the xenobiology department. They should be handled with the
      utmost care - they are some of the deadliest beings in the known universe!'

      will not literally freeze things!'

  Muskets:
  - unknown: The prepackaged songs (Space Asshole, Cuban Pete, Darkest Honk, etc)

  /tg/station team:
  - unknown: ' Day of Forum revival!'
  Agouri updated:
  - unknown: I was always bothered by how unprofessional it was of Nanotransen (in
      before &gt;Nanotransen &gt;professionalism) to just lay expensive spacesuits
      in racks and just let them be. Well, no more. Introducing...
  - unknown: Suit Storage Units. Rumored to actually be repurposed space radiators,
      these wondrous machines will store any kind of spacesuit in a clean and sterile
      environment.
  - unknown: The user can interact with the unit in various ways. You can start a
      UV cauterisation cycle to disinfect its contents, effectively sterilising and
      cleaning eveyrthing from the suits/helmets stored inside.
  - unknown: A sneaky yordle can also hide in it, if he so desires, or hack it, or
      lock it or do a plethora of shady stuff with it. Beware, though, there's plenty
      of dangerous things you can do with it, both to you and your target.
  - unknown: The Unit's control panel can be accessed by screwdriving it. That's all
      I'm willing to say, I'd like to let the players find out what each hack option
      does and doesn't. Will add more stuff later.
  - unknown: Added Command Space suit, Chief Engineer space suit and Chief Medical
      Officer spacesuit (In a new space that you'll probably notice by yourself) to
      make it easier for you to look like a special snowflake.
  - unknown: EVA and CMO office modified to accomodate the new suits and SSUs. Look,
      I'm not a competent mapper, okay? Fuck you too. A mapper is strongly recommended
      to rearrange my half assed shit.
  - unknown: Soda cans, cigarette packets, cigarettes and cigars as well as bullet
      casings are now considered trash and can be picked up by the trashbag. Now you
      can annoy the janitor even more!

      href="http://bspbox.com/">http://bspbox.com</a>. Thanks a lot, bro.'
  - unknown: With the recent forum fuss and all that, I've got a thread to specifically
      contain  rants and bug reports about this update. <a href="http://tgstation13.servehttp.com/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=3&amp;t=5569&amp;p=45549&amp;sid=a4a96f5b0e896cd3e3f7c1db73f09f1b#p45549">Click

      they begin starving. And so, hungry Metroids are a force to be feared.'
  - unknown: The Cargo computers now have the ability to cancel pending orders to
      refund credits. This was put in place so that idiots couldn't waste all the
      cargo points and run off. However, if the shuttle is en route to the station
      you won't be able to cancel orders.
  - unknown: 'Bugfix: the manifest has been fixed! Additionally, the manfiest is now
      updated realtime; job changes and new arrivals will be automatically updated

2011-08-28:
  Doohl:

      is applied globally and the library's bible printer will print the same bibles.
  - unknown: Joy to the world! The Library's bible-printing function now has a one-minute
      cooldown. One minute may seem a little extreme, but it is necessary to prevent
      people from spamming the fuck out of everything with 100,000,000,000,000 carbon-copy
      bibles.
  - unknown: Tweaked Metroids a bit; they are slightly more aggressive and become

      it down disposals. At the mail room, the cargo tech will then tag and send the
      package to the department.

  - unknown: <b>The radio overhaul 'Telecommunications' is now LIVE.</b> Please submit
      any opinions/feedback in the forums and check the wiki article on Telecommunications
      for some more info for the curious.
  - unknown: The AI satellite has been replaced with a communications satellite. You
      can get there via teleporter or space, just like the AI satellite. I highly
      recommend not bum-rushing the new satellite, as you may be killed if you don't
      have access. It's a very secure place.
  - unknown: Once a human's toxicity level reaches a certain point, they begin throwing
      up. This is a natural, but overall ineffective method of purging toxins from
      the body.
  - unknown: You can now travel Z-levels in Nuclear Emergency mode (the nuke disk
      is still bound to the station). This means the nuclear agents can and probably
      will fly off into space to blow up the comm satellite and shut down communications.

      fully working, sorry for that. Some minor icon bugs fixed. Now I''m free to

      suggestions for extra uses, tears etc go <a href="http://code.google.com/p/tgstation13/source/detail?r=3005"
      target="_blank">here</a>.
  - unknown: What <b>ARE</b> newscasters? Fans of the Transmetropolitan series might
      find them familiar. Basically, they're terminals connected to a station-wide
      news network. Users are able to submit channels of their own (one per identified
      user, with channels allowing feed stories by other people or, if you want the
      channel to be your very own SpaceJournal, being submit-locked to you), while
      others are able to read the channels, either through the terminals or a printed
      newspaper which contains every news-story circulating at the time of printing.
  - unknown: 'About censorship: You can censor channels and feed stories through Security
      casters, found in the HoS''es office and the Bridge. Alternatively, if you want
      a channel to stop operating completely, you can mark it with a D-Notice which
      will freeze it and make all its messages unreadable for the duration it is in
      effect. If you''ve got the access, of course.'
  - unknown: Basically I think of the newscaster as nothing more as an additional
      Roleplaying tool. Grab a newspaper along with your donuts and coffee from the
      machines, read station rumors when you're manning your desk, be a station adventurer
      or journalist with your very own network journal!
  - unknown: I would ask for a bit of respect when using the machine, though. I removed
      all and any channel and story restrictions regarding content, so you might end
      up seeing channels that violate the rules, Report those to the admins.
  - unknown: "Finally, due to the removal of the enforced \"Channel\" string, it's\
      \ recommended to name your channels properly (\"Station Paranormal Activity\
      \ Channel\" instead of \"Station Paranormal Activity\", for example\")\n\n  "

      with each other.
  - unknown: Powercell chargers have been buffed so now higher capacity cells are
      actually useable.

      you can create scripts to interact with the radio! For more information, head
      here: http://wiki.nanotrasen.com/index.php?title=NT_Script But before you do,
      if you are not an antag, do not create bad scripts which hinders communication.'
  - rscadd: Cameras, mulebots, APCs, radios and cyborgs can have signallers attached
      to their wires, like airlocks!
  - rscadd: Cameras have non-randomized wires and the power wire when pulsed will
      now toggle the camera on and off.
  - rscadd: Cyborgs have a new wire, the lockdown wire! It will disable/enable the
      lockdown of a Cyborg when pulsed.
  - rscadd: The traffic control computer (or more commonly known as the computer which
      lets you add NTSL scripts) will now have a user log, which will log all user
      activity. Other users can then view that log and see who has been uploading
      naughty scripts!
  - rscadd: NTSL has two new functions! time() and timestamp(format) will help you
      increase the range of types of scripts you can make, especially time(); since
      you can then make the scripts know the different between each execution by storing
      the results in memory.
  - rscadd: Two new advance disease symptoms! Their names are "Longevity" and "Anti-Bodies
      Metabolism". Have fun experimenting with them!

      again.

      changes there easier.

      carved pumpkins and corncob pipes. -Added mutations for ambrosia and lemon trees.
      -Added more wood items for tower cap wood construction. -Added soil to plant
      seeds in. Make it by crushing up sandstone. Soil does not have indicators like
      trays do! Watch your plants carefully!'

      and make simple leather items. -RnD can create a new tool for botanists: The

      boost yield.'

      -You now get more descriptive messages when applying mutagen to plant trays.
      -Removed sugarcane seeds from the vending machine. Added the sugarcane seeds
      to the seeds crate.

      type now.
  - imageadd: New shotgun sprites by Khodoque!

  - tweak: -Somatoray is hopefully more useful and less buggy when used on trays.
      -Botanists now have morgue access, because of their ability to clone via replica

      WITH THEM.
  - rscadd: "-Emergency Toolboxes now contain smaller, lighter fire extinguishers\
      \ that actually fit inside them!\n\t"

  Sieve:
  - rscdel: 'Reverted dismemberment, the recent gun changes, and Tarajans. Before
      you shit up the forums, read this:'
  - unknown: Dismemberment was ported from Bay12, but only halfway, and there were
      several problems with it. I know many people really liked it, but as it stood
      it did not fit the playstyle here at all. This <b>had</b> to be removed, there
      is work on a more fitting system, but this had to be taken out first regardless,
      and the longer people beat around the bush the worse the situation got.
  - unknown: The gun change was made for no real reason and was pretty problematic,
      so reverting that should mean there are a lot less 'accidental suicides.'
  - unknown: Tarjans were reverted by request as well, and since keeping them working
      after removing dismemberment would be a stupid amount of work.
2012-05-11:

  - rscadd: When you receive a PDA message, the content is displayed to you if the
      PDA is located somewhere on your person (so not in your backpack). You will
      also get a reply button there. This will hopefully make PDA communication easier.
  - rscadd: <b>New hotkeys!</b> delete is the now the 'stop dragging' hotkey, insert
      is the 'cycle intents' hotkey.
2012-05-22:
  Icarus:
  - rscadd: RIG helmets can now be used as flashlights, just like hardhats. Credit
      to Sly for the sprites.
  - tweak: HoP's office has been remapped and made into his private office. Conference
      Room can now be accessed from the main hall.
2012-05-23:
  Errorage:
  - tweak: Some of the more pressing issues with the new user interface were addressed.
      These include the health indicator being too far up, the open inventory taking
      a lot of space, hotkey buttons not being removable and suit storage not being
      accessible enough.
  - rscadd: A toggle-hotkey-buttons verb was added to the OOC tab, which hides the
      pull, drop and throw buttons for people who prefer to use hotkeys and never
      use the buttons.
  - rscadd: Added a character setup option which allows you to pick between the Midnight,
      Orange and Old iconsets for the user interface.

  - rscadd: Any PDA with access to the Security Records can now, by the normal forensic
      scanner function, store data the same way as the detective's scanner.  Scanning
      the PDA in the detective's computer will copy all scanned data into the database.

  Errorage:
  - rscadd: You can now make restraints from cable. It takes 15 lengths of cable to
      make a pair of restraints, they are applied the same way as handcuffs and have
      the same effects. It however only takes 30s to remove them by using the resist
      verb or button. You can also remove them from someone by using wirecutters on
      the handcuffed person.
  - rscadd: 'Added four new cable colors: pink, orange, cyan and white. Engineer belts
      spawn with yellow, red or orange cables while toolboxes and tool closets spawn
      with all 8 colors.'

      Fantastic icons by supercrayon!<br/>Created with a sheet of cardboard.
2012-06-28:
  Carn:
  - rscadd: Alien hunters will now cloak when using the 'stalk' movement intent. Whilst
      cloaked they will use up their plasma reserves. They can however cloak as long
      as they like. Using the Lay-down verb will allow them to remain cloaked without
      depleting their plasma reserves,  hence allowing them to lay ambushes for unsuspecting
      prey. Should a hunter attack anybody, or get knocked down in any way,  they
      will become visible. Hopefully this allows for more strategic/stealthy gameplay
      from aliens. On the other hand, I may have totally  screwed the balance so feedback/other-ideas
      are welcome.
  - rscdel: 'Removed the invisibility verb from the alien hunter caste. '
2012-06-30:
  Icarus:
  - rscadd: Added Petethegoat's basic mirrors to the map. They allow you to change

  - bugfix: Various bugfixes
2012-07-05:
  Carn:
  - tweak: Alien larva now chestburst even after their host has died.
  - tweak: Aliens can now slap facehuggers onto faces so they can infect mobs which
      lay down (or those stuck to nests).
  - tweak: Aliens can now slash security cameras to deactivate them.
2012-07-06:
  Giacom:
  - rscadd: Bottles can now be broken over people's heads! To do this, you must have
      the harm intent on and you must be targeting the person's head. This change
      affects alcoholic bottles only. It does not change pill bottles or chemistry
      bottles. Helmets help protect you from damage and the regents of the bottles
      will splash over the victim.
  - rscadd: 'AI''s now have access to a PDA. Note: It is not PDA-bomb-able'
  - rscadd: Health analyzers and medical PDAs now give a time of death when used on

  - rscadd: pAI gets a better PDA that can actually receive messages from people.
      They can also instantly reply like everybody else now and they can toggle their
      receiver/signaller/ringer.
  - rscadd: You can show the AI the notes on your PDA by holding it up to a camera.
      When you show up a paper/pda to the camera the AI can now click on your name
      to go to you, if you're near a camera. People who are Unknown will not have
      a link; which would've allowed the AI to track them.
  - rscadd: Made the" common server" and the "preset right receiver" listen for frequencies
      144.1 to 148.9. This will allow people to use different frequencies to talk
      to eachother without bothering the common channel. It will also allow Revs and
      Cultists to work with each other; everything is still logged though so it still
      has risks.
  - rscadd: Increased the maximum frequency limit for handheld radios and intercoms.
      It will give you the option to just use station bounced radios on a higher frequency
      so that anyone with a headset can't simply tune in.
  - rscadd: Created an All-In-One Grinder that is suppose to replace the blender,
      juicer and reagent grinder all together. Meaning any department that has a juicer,
      blender and grinder will instead get this. It will help people be more independent
      from Chemistry by recycling foods and plants.

      Roulette with your fellow crew members! You can use it like a normal gun but
      you will need to cycle through the chamber slots until you hit the bullet. Only
      admin spawnable.
  Willox and Messycakes:
  - rscadd: pAI Emoticons! Allows each pAI to set their screen to display an array
      of faces! Click on 'Screen Display' in the pAI OS for a list.

  - rscadd: Added the Light Replacer. This is a device that can auto replace lights
      that are broken, missing or burnt. Currently it is found in the Janitor's closet
      and Janitor Borgs can equip it. You can refill it with glass, or if you're a
      Cyborg, just recharge. It is emaggable and will replace lights with rigged lights.
      The light's explosion was nerfed to help balance it and it is very noticable
      when you are holding an emagged Light Replacer.
  - tweak: The Janitor's equipment locator, on their PDA, will now tell you the direction
      of the equipment.
2012-07-22:

  - tweak: You can now research and build the Light Replacer.
  - tweak: You can now store donuts in the donut box. The next donut you pull out
      will be the last one you put in.
  - tweak: APCs will auto-turn on if there is enough power in the grid, even if the
      powercell is below 30%. The APC needs to be charged for a long enough time before
      it starts turning equipment on, to avoid spazzing out. If you have any problems
      with it, such as equipment turning off and on repeatedly then please make an
      issue report with a screenshot of the APC.
2012-07-24:
  Errorage:
  - tweak: Both the chef and bartender have access to the bar area so both can serve
      if the other is incompetent or does not exist. Bartender's shotgun and shaker
      were moved to his back room and the booze-o-mat is now ID restricted to the
      bartender.

  - rscadd: You can now use crayons to color eggs
  - rscadd: Mice have invaded the station!
  Giacom:
  - rscadd: All radios now only work in their Z level. This means that the CommSat
      has a few more additions to work with this change. There is now a new Telecomms
      Machine called the Relay which allows information to travel across Z levels.
      It it then linked to a new machine called the Hub, which will receive information
      from the Relays and send it to the buses. Because every Z level needs these
      relays, which are linked up with Receivers/Broadcasters, every Z level will
      get one. There is one in the station, in the RD's office, one in Telecomms as
      always, one in the Ruskie station which is turned off and hidden from the HUB's
      linked list. The last one is in Mining but the location for it has not been
      decided yet.
  - tweak: PDAs now need to be in a Z level with a functioning Relay/Comms Network
      in order to send messages. It will also send uncompressed (scrambled) messages
      like you would with the ordinary voice messages.
  - imageadd: 'Added some of WJohnston''s sprites. Added a new mining borg sprite,
      Added a new high tech security airlock, Added the new telecomm sprites for Relays.
      Hubs were given old Bus sprites. '

      before you can throw them.
  - rscadd: 'New map changes by Ikarrus. AI Upload Foyer is now Secure Tech Access,
      and the outer door only requires Bridge access. Attached to it are two new rooms:
      The messaging server room and the communications relay. The comms relay room
      runs off its own SMES unit like the AI, so it won''t be affected by powersinks'
2012-08-01:
  Giacom:
  - tweak: I've made some adjustments to the Fireball spell. I've changed it to shoot
      in the player's facing direction instead of you having to pick a name from a
      list. It will explode upon contact of a person, if it hits an obstacle or if
      it shoots for too long. To make up for the fireball not being able to go diagonal
      I've shortened the cooldown to 10 seconds. It still can hurt you badly and knock
      you down if you shoot it at a wall. Lastly, it now lights up so it'll show up
      in dark rooms easily.
  Sieve:
  - rscadd: Borgs can now have an encryption key installed into their internal radios.
      Simply ID, open the panel, and use the key to insert it (Screwdriver to remove)
  - rscadd: Due to that as well, borgs have a 'Toggle Broadcast Mode' button for their
      radios, which changes the broadcast type between station-bounced (Non-reliant
      on TComms), and subspace (Required for department channels)
  - tweak: Also changed the binary chat for consistency, now for the prefix is ':b'
      for everyone, not just one for humans and one for borgs/AIs/pAIs
  - tweak: Based on feedback, Nuke Op pinpointers now automagically change between
      shuttle and disk mode when the nuke is armed or disarmed.

      Fire helmets are red and white hardhats, found in all fire closets.

      cold, so make your choice count.

  - tweak: All helper bots (excluding MULEs) have an access panel and maint panel,
      access being for behavior and maint for internal work
  - tweak: To open the maint panel, the access panel needs to be unlocked, then you
      use a screwdriver. There you can emag/repair it to your heart's content. (Emagging
      the access panel will also unlock it permanently)
  - tweak: Helper bots are now repaired by using a welder when their maint panel is
      open

      two reagents that trigger this to happen. I will tell you the first required
      reagent. Uranium. Have fun!
  - tweak: I have made most chemicals need 3-5 or more chemicals in order to react
      to a turf. For instance, you need at least 5 units of thermite splashed on a
      wall for it to burn down."
  - tweak: The EMP kit, that you can buy through the uplink, has two more grenades
      in them now. Making the box full of EMP grenades!
  - tweak: Changed the EMP grenade's range to be much bigger.

      canisters, instead you make them from an autolathe. The construction and deconstruction
      for them has also changed, so look it up or experiment it with yourself to see
      how to setup the cameras now. Cameras also get wires, like airlocks and APCs.
      There''s two duds, a focus wire, a power wire, an alarm wire and a light wire.
      Protip: You can see which one is the alarm wire by pulsing it.'
  - imageadd: Added a red phone and placed it in the Cyborg Station. Sprite by Pewtershmitz!
      You'll also find an AI restorer there, replacing the computer frame.
  - rscadd: Cameras aren't all X-ray anymore. The AI won't be able to see what room
      you are in if there's no normal camera inside that room or if there's no X-ray
      camera nearby..
  - rscadd: Cameras get upgrades! Currently there's X-ray, EMP-Proof and Motion. You'll
      find the EMP-Proof and Motion cameras in the normal places (Singularity Pen
      &amp; EVA), the new X-ray cameras can be found in the Dormitory and Bathrooms,
      plus some extra ones to invade your privacy. See if you can smash them all.
  - tweak: 'Alien Larva can bite simple animals (see: Ian, Runtime, Mice) to kill
      them and gain a small amount of growing points.'
  - tweak: Space travel was tweaked to be more random when changing Z levels. This
      will stop people and items from being stuck in an infinite loop, as they will
      eventually hit something to make them stop.

  - rscadd: '-Changes flour from an item to a container-held reagent. All recipes
      have been updated to use 5 units of reagent flour for every item required previously.   This
      has a few advantages: The 16(!) sacks of flour previously in the kitchen cabinet
      have been condensed to an equivalent 3 sacks. Beer is now brewable with universal
      enzyme, and converting lots of wheat into flour should be less tedious. Also,
      flour grenades, etc.  Because of this, flour is now obtained from the all-in-one
      blender rather than the processor, and spaghetti noodles are made with 5 units
      of flour in the microwave.'
  Giacom:
  - tweak: Removed cameras from bots (NOT BORGS). They weren't working well with freelook
      and I felt that since they weren't used at all, they wouldn't be missed.

  - bugfix: Added an additional check to stop changelings sharing powers/becomming
      un-absorbable/etc by absorbing eachother and then rejuvinating from death.
  - tweak: Cloaked Aliens are now slightly easier to see, so they should avoid strongly
      lit areas when possible. They can still lay down to become even stealthier though.
      Let me know what you think, it's only a minor sprite change.

      after-all. Meaning, when power is low the airlocks will still work until the
      environmental channel on the APC is turned off. This applies to all the door
      control buttons too. Pipe meters now use the environmental power channel. If
      you have any comments have this change, please let me know in the feedback section

      very expensive chemical wise to absorb (download), not so much to channel (upload)!
      You cannot achieve your objective by sharing DNA.
  - rscadd: Mimic Voice! You can form your voice of a name you enter. You won't look
      like them but when you talk, people will hear the name of who you selected.
      While you're mimicing, you can't regenerate chemicals.
  - rscadd: Extract DNA! A power that allows you to silently sting someone and take
      their DNA! Meaning you do not have to absorb someone to become them. Extracting
      their DNA doesn't count towards completing your objectives.
  - rscadd: You can now get flares from red emergency toolboxes. Has a 50% chance
      of a flash-light or a flare spawning.
  - imageadd: Flare icon by Ausops!
  - rscadd: Thanks to RavingManiac (Smoke Carter), Roros now lay eggs which can grow
      into baby roros or be used for cooking recipes. Scientists will need to expose
      the egg to plasma for it to hatch; while it is orange (grown).

      are for the glasses equipment slot. Science and the assembly line are given
      a pair.

      Line will instead have two normal flashes and eight synthetic flashes. Synthetic
      flashes only work once but are designed to be used in construction of Cyborgs.

      (Which can be a turf, object or mob) This creates possibilities like chloral
      eggs, lube eggs, and many more.
  - rscadd: Aliens can now acid walls and floors! Not R-Walls though.
  - tweak: Facehugger throw range reduced to 5, so aim at humans that are 2 tiles
      apart from the edge of your screen.
  - tweak: Making eggs is a little more expensive but secreting resin is cheaper.
      (Both cost 75 now)
  - tweak: Aliens no longer have a random duration of stunning humans, it's a constant
      value now of the lower based value.
  - tweak: Acid is less random and will be more reliable. Don't bother aciding stuff
      more than once, as it will waste plasma.
  - rscadd: You can now target non-dense items (such as facehuggers) with a gun.

      (firesuits, space suits, fire helmets, ...) will now properly protect. The pressure
      damage indicator will update properly based on the pressure effects on you.
      Black (low) and red (high) mean you are taking damage.
  - tweak: Slightly slowed down the speed at which your body temperature changes if
      you are in a very hot or very cold area. The speed at which you recover from

      Implant will be able to enter the away mission, but unable to return from it.
      Not only can they be used for getting rid of dangerous criminals, but revs/stationheads
      count as dead while on the away mission, and traitor/changeling/wizard assassination
      targets count as dead if they're on the away mission at round end, allowing
      for those objectives to be completed peacefully.
  - rscadd: Added medical hardsuits, sprited by Majorsephiroth. Two of them spawn
      in EVA. Their most unique/medical oriented feature is being able to hold a medkit

      the Wizard's Spellbook. It will animate objects and items, but not machines,
      to fight for you. The animated objects will not attack the bearer of the staff
      which animates them, meaning if you lose your staff, or if it gets stolen, your
      minions will turn on you.

      implants, and raw materials can also be bought from cargo for a significant
      number of points (subject to change)

      a mistake or two. Please report any bugs to the usual place
2013-08-12:

  - tweak: Changed the blob balance to make the blob start strong but grow slower,
      resulting in rounds where the blob doesn't instantly get killed off if found

      no longer have to quarantine the station.

  - rscadd: Magical Wands that can be spawned during Summon Magic! They come in a
      variety of effects that mimic both classical wizard spells and all new ones.
      They come precharged but lack the means to refill them once their magical energy
      is depleted... Fire efficently!
  - rscadd: Be aware of the new Charge spell, which can take normally useless spent
      wands and give them new life! This mysterious effect has been found to wear
      down the overall magical potency of wands over time however. Beyond wands the
      clever magical user can find ways to use this spell on other things that may
      benefit from a magical charge...

      defeat death itself! Look out for this invaluable magical tool during castings
      of Summon Magic.
  - rscadd: Be on the lookout for a new apprentice! This noble mage is a different

  - rscadd: Gibtonite, the explosive ore, can now be found on the asteroid. It's very
      hard to tell between it and diamonds, at first glance.
  - rscadd: Gibtonite deposits will blow up after a countdown when you attempt to
      mine it, but you can stop it with an analyzer at any time. It makes for a good
      mining explosive.
  - rscadd: The closer you were to the explosion when you analyze the Gibtonite deposit,
      the better the Gibtonite you can get from it.
  - rscadd: Once extracted, it must be struck with a pickaxe or drill to activate
      it, where it will go through its countdown again to explode!
  - tweak: Explosives will no longer destroy the ore inside of asteroid walls or lying
      on the floor.

2014-02-01:
  Ergovisavi:
  - rscadd: Walking Mushrooms will now attack and eat each other! They're all a little
      unique from each other, no two shrooms are exactly alike, and a better quality
      harvest means stronger Walking Shrooms. Pit them against each other for your
      entertainment.
  - rscadd: Each mushroom will have a different colored cap to identify them. When
      mushrooms eat each other, they get stronger. The resulting mushroom will drop
      more slices when cut down to harvest, and will have better quality slices.
  - rscadd: Don't hurt them yourself, though, or you'll bruise them, and mushrooms
      won't get stronger from eating a bruised mushroom. If your mushroom faints,
      feed it a mushroom such as a plump helmet to get it back on its feet. It will
      slowly regenerate to full health eventually.
2014-02-02:
  Demas:
  - rscadd: Attack sounds for all melee weapons! No more silent attacks.
  - tweak: The volume of an object's attack sound is based on the weapon's force and/or
      weight class.
  - rscadd: Welders, lighters, matches, cigarettes, energy swords and energy axes
      have different attack sounds based on whether they're on or off.
  - rscadd: Weapons that do no damage play a tap sound. The exceptions are the bike
      horn, which still honks, and the banhammer, which plays adminhelp.ogg. Surely
      nothing can go wrong with that last one.
  - tweak: When you tap someone with an object, the message now uses "tapped" or "patted"
      instead of attacked. The horn still uses HONKED, and the banhammer still uses
      BANNED.
  - bugfix: You won't get the "armour has blocked an attack" message for harmless
      attacks anymore.
  - rscadd: Adds 5 force to the lighter when it's lit. Same as when you accidentally
      burn yourself lighting it.
  - rscadd: Removes boldness from item attack messages on non-human mobs. The attack
      is bolded for a player controlling a non-human mob. Now your eyes won't jump
      to the chat when it's Pun Pun who's being brutalised.
  - bugfix: Blood will no longer come out of non-human mobs if the attack is harmless.
  - tweak: Adds a period at the end of the catatonic human examine message. That's
      been bugging me for years.
  - tweak: The activation and deactivation sounds of toy swords, energy swords and
      energy shields are slightly quieter. Energy swords and shields are now slightly
      louder than toys.
  - bugfix: You can no longer light things with burnt matches.
  - tweak: Match, cigarette and lighter attack verbs, forces and damage types change
      based on whether the object is lit or not.
  - bugfix: Fixes a bug with the energy blade that kept it at weight class 5 after
      it was deactivated. Who cares, it disappears upon deactivation.
  - tweak: Changes the welder out of fuel message slightly to be less fragmented.
  - tweak: Removes dead air from a lot of weapon sound effects to make them more responsive.
      In other words, the fire extinguisher attack sound will play a lot sooner after
      you attack than before.
  - tweak: Equalised the peak volumes of most weapon sounds to be -0.1dB in an attempt
      to make volumes based on force more consistent across different sounds.
2014-02-03:
  Demas:
  - tweak: Changes windoor and newscaster attack messages to be consistent with windows
      and grilles. This removes the distracting boldness from windoor attack messages,
      which is reserved for userdanger, and names the attacker.
  - rscadd: Thrown items now play a sound effect on impact. The volume of the sound
      is based on the item's throwforce and/or weight class.
  - tweak: The fireaxe now has 15 throwforce, when previously it had only 1. But why
      would you throw it away, anyway?
  - rscadd: Projectiles now play a sound upon impact. The volume of the sound depends
      on the damage done by the projectile. Damageless projectiles such as electrodes
      have static volumes. Practise laser and laser tag beams have no impact sound.
  - soundadd: Added sear.ogg for the impacts of damaging beams such as lasers. It
      may be replaced if player feedback proves negative.
2014-02-05:

      crowbarring them. While constructing machines, examining them will tell you
      what parts you're missing.

      with your genetics.

      plasma to generate symptoms. You can take a single unit by using a dropper,
      if you change its unit transfer amount in the object tab..
  - tweak: Changed the map to make it harder to escape from the Labor Camp. Please
      continue using it.
  Miauw:

  - rscadd: NT R&amp;D; releases AI Patch version 2553.03.18, allowing all Nanotrasen
      AIs to override the access restrictions on any airlock in case of emergency.
      Nanotrasen airlocks have been outfitted with new amber warning lights that will
      flash while the override is active. Should maintenance teams need to restore
      an airlock's restrictions without using the AI, pulsing the airlock's ID Scanner
      wire will reset the override.

  - rscadd: Gravity is no longer beamed from CentCom! Instead, there is a new gravity
      generator stored near Engineering that will provide all the gravity for the
      station and the z level. Please remember that it gives off a lot of radiation
      when charging or discharging, so wear protection.
  MrPerson:
  - rscadd: Added a new, somewhat experimental system to delete things. This is basically
      a port from /vg/, so big thanks to N3X15.
  - rscadd: As a result, bombs and the singularity should be much less laggy.
  - experiment: There may be issues with "phantom objects" or other problems with
      stuff that's suppoed to be deleted or objects interacting with deleted objects.
      Please report any issues right away!

      \ to better resist cryptographic attacks by the enemy.\n\t\t\t<br/><br/>*New\
      \ internal wiring will be able to withstand attacks, and panel wires will no\
      \ longer be left unusable after an attack.\n\t\t\t<br/>*Welding tools will now\
      \ be able to cut through welded doors that have been damaged.\n\t\t\t<br/>*Damaged\

      \t\t\t<br/>*Airlocks will not be able to operate autonomously until the electronics\
      \ are replaced.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"
  - imageadd: Hair sprites have been given a visual lift. For best results, set your
      hair color to be slightly lighter than how you want it to look. For dark hair,
      do not use a color darker than 80% black.

  Aranclanos:
  - tweak: Workaround with the click cooldowns. They should feel faster. If you think
      that anything needs a click cooldown (like grilles, mobs, etc.), report it to
      me.
  - experiment: Here's the fun part, this is a test for the community and players,
      I hope I won't be forced to revert this and hear "this is why we can't have
      nice things". Again, if anything needs a cooldown, report it to me. Have fun
      with your fast clicks spessmans.

  Ikarrus:
  - rscadd: Fabricator blueprints for cyborg parts have been updated to allow the
      debugging of cyborg units prior to boot. To access the debug functions, assemble
      a cyborg following standard procedure. Before inserting the MMI, use a multitool
      on the cyborg body. Note that this update also moves designation data into the
      system files, so pens can no longer be used to name cyborgs.
  MrPerson:
  - rscadd: Toggling the "Play admin midis" preference will pause any playing songs.
      Turning midis back on will resume the current song where it was.

  - experiment: <b>Sacrifice Cult - Cult has received a massive overhaul to how it
      works, focusing more on cult magics and sacrificing unbelievers. The most important
      changes are:</b>
  - tweak: Cult starts off with alot more cultists, 6 cultists below 30 players and
      9 above. The HoP can no longer be a round start cultist but is still convertible.
  - tweak: Cultists start off with join, blood, self, and hell. These give the runes
      for the sacrifice and convert.
  - tweak: Conversions now require three cultists and converts no longer reward words,
      words must be obtained via sacrifice
  - tweak: Sacrificing players traps their soul in a soul stone, which can then be
      used on construct shells to implant the souls in them
  - tweak: Constructs shells can be summoned via a new rune (travel, hell, technology)
  - bugfix: You can no longer convert the sacrifice target, you dozzy sods
  - experiment: Summoning Narsie when she is not an objective leads to !!FUN!!

      corgis are in the new system
  - experiment: Holy Water will DECONVERT cultists, takes around 35 units and two
      minutes to succeed
  - experiment: Hitting a mob that contains holy water with a tome will convert that
      water to unholy water, conversely hitting any container that contains unholy
      water with a bible as chaplain will 'cleanse' the taint.
  - experiment: Unholy water works like a combination synaptazine and hyperzine, with
      a twist of branes dimarge and highly toxic to non-cultists
  - rscadd: Cargo can order a religious supplies crate - it contains flasks of holy
      water, candles, bibles, and robes
  - experiment: Cultists have an innate ability to communicate to the cult hive mind
      (BE AWARE - THIS DOES A LOT OF DAMAGE), cultists can also communicate via the
      new Commune option on their tomes (the Read Tome option has been shifted under
      the Notes option)
  MrStonedOne:
  - rscadd: Cyborgs can now use AI click shortcuts. (shift click on doors opens them,
      etc) (including ones added below)

  - rscadd: Certain Enemies of the Corporation have discovered a critical exploit
      in the firmware of several NanoTrasen robots that could prevent the safe shutdown
      of units corrupted by illegally modified ID cards, dubbed "cryptographic sequencers".
  - rscadd: NanoTrasen requires more research into this exploit, this we have issued
      a patch for AI and Cyborg software to simulate this malfunction. All NanoTrasen
      AI units are advised to only allow testing in a safe and contained environment.
      The robot can safely be reset at any time.
  - experiment: Unfortunately, a robot corrupted by a "cryptographic sequencer" still
      cannot be reset by any means. NanoTrasen urges regular maintenance and care
      of all robots to reduce replacement costs.

  - rscadd: 'Thanks to Nanotrasen''s Engineering division, the power wiring of the
      station has a received a complete overhaul. Here are the highlight features
      in CentCom report :'
  - tweak: 'Improved way of connecting cables! Finished is the time of "laying and
      praying" : it''s now as simple as matching ends of each cables!'
  - tweak: Unified way of connecting machines! Every machine is connected to a powernet
      through a node cable (it still needs to be anchored to receive power though)!
  - tweak: Lots of improvements in the cable cutting tools! Gone is the odd magic
      of physically separated yet still connected powernets (contact CentCom Engineering
      Division if you still witness something weird, we always have a fired form ready
      for our engineers!)!
  - rscadd: Any conscientious (or not!) Station Engineer may check an "updated wiring
      manual" at http://www.tgstation13.org/wiki/Wiring#Power_Wires

  Kelenius:
  - rscadd: 'After the years of extensive research into xenobiology, and thousands
      of scientists lost to the slimes, we have finally come to admitting that we
      don''t have a clue how they work. However, we''ve outlined a few facts, and
      managed to breed a new kind of slimes. They will be shipped to your station
      on the next shifts. They are different from the ones they are used to in the
      following:'
  - rscadd: Their sight is better than ever, and now they can finally see things that
      are not directly pressed against them. Beware, they may appear more aggressive!
  - rscadd: Their memory has also become better, and they will now remember the people
      who fed them. As a note, you need to grab the monkey or push it to show to the
      slime that you're giving it to them, and it's not just walking in.
  - rscadd: Apparently, not only we have studied them, but they have also studied
      us. Slimes are now capable of showing various emotions, mimicking humans. Use
      it to your advantage.
  - rscadd: There are reports of slimes showing signs of sentience. Further research
      is recommended.
  - rscadd: 'One of the reported signs is their speech capability. Following facts
      have been gathered: they talk more often to those who feed them; they react
      to being called by the number, but ''slimes'' is also acceptable; they are able
      to understand being ordered to "follow" someone, or "stop". There is a report
      of slime releasing the assistant after a scientist shouted at it, and then calmly
      ordered a slime to stop.'
  - rscadd: We've made a modification of a health scanner that is intended for the
      use on slimes. Two are available in the smartfridge.
  - tweak: We've come to a conclusion that 5 units of reagents are not necessary to
      cause slime core reactions. You actually only need one unit.

  Gun Hog:
  - rscadd: Nanotrasen programmers have discovered a potential exploit involving a
      station's door control networks. With sufficient computing power, the network
      can be overloaded and forced to open or bolt closed every airlock at once.
  - experiment: Some reports suggest that the latest firmware update to Artifical
      Intelligence units installed in our research stations may contain this exploit.
      Any such reports that state that should a station's AI unit "malfunction", it
      may gain the ability to use this exploit to initate a full lockdown of the station.
      Fire locks and blast doors are also said to be affected.
  - rscadd: Nanotrasen officially holds no validity to these reports. We recommend
      that station personnel disregard such rumors.
2014-06-11:

2014-09-07:
  Gun Hog:
  - rscadd: Nanotrasen scientists have released a Heads-Up-Display (HUD) upgrade for
      all AI and Cyborg units! Cyborgs have had Medical sensors and a Security datacore
      integrated into their core hardware, replacing the need for a specific module.
  - rscadd: AI units are now able to have suit sensor or crew manifest data displayed
      to them as a visual overlay. When viewing a crewmember with suit sensors set
      to health monitoring, the health status will be available on the AI's medical
      HUD. In Security mode, the role as printed on the crewmember's ID card will
      be displayed to the AI.
  - rscadd: Any entity with a Security or Medical HUD active will recieve appropriate
      messages on that HUD.
  Ikarrus:

      to its arsenal. These tricky pouches can even fit under floor plating!
  Ikarrus:
  - wip: Adds Gang War, a new game mode still in alpha development.
  Incoming5643:
  - tweak: After a public relations nightmare in which a horde of 30 assistants violently
      dismembered a sole commander the revolution has begin tactically reducing their
      initial presence in stations with weak command structures. Should stations add
      to their command staff during the shift additional support will be provided.
  - tweak: Too many instances of crying CMOs hiding in the lockers of supposedly secured
      revoulutionary stations has lead to a crackdown on revolutionary policy. You
      must kill or maroon the entire command staff, reguardless of when they reached
      the station.
  - rscadd: Intense study into the underlying structure of the universe has revealed
      that everything fits into a massive SPACECUBE. This deep and profound understanding
      has led to a revolution in cross surface movement, and spacemen can look forward
      to a new era of predictable and safe space-fairing.
  Jordie0608:
  - tweak: Grille damage update, humans now deal less unarmed damage to grilles while
      projectiles and items deal more.
  - tweak: Replaced all AI turrets with porta-turrets that work on LoS instead of
      area and can be individually configured
  Miauw:
  - bugfix: Voice changer masks work again.
  - tweak: You can now turn voice changer masks on/off by activating them in your
      hand. They start off.
  - experiment: The amount of TC has been increased to 20, but the price of all items
      has been doubled as well
  - experiment: With this, the prices of stealthy items has been slightly decreased
      and the prices of offensive items slightly increased (+/- 1 TC)
  RemieRichards, JJRcop:
  - rscadd: New research in the area of robotics has been published on Maintenance
      Drones, little robots capable of repairing and improving the station. Unfortunately,
      all of the research was lost in a catastrophic server fire, but we know they
      can be made, so it's up to <b><i>you</i></b> to re-discover them! Make us proud!
  phil235:
  - experiment: Changed all clone damage descriptions to use the term cellular damage
      to avoid confusion with genetics mutations.
2014-10-05:
  Ikarrus:
  - bugfix: Character Save Files will now remember Species.
  Miauw:
  - soundadd: Added 5 new maintenance ambience tracks, made by Cuboos.
  Nobalm:
  - rscadd: Added examine descriptions to twenty eight objects.
  Paprika:
  - experiment: Due to some payroll cuts affecting lower-rank crewmembers on Space
      Station 13, we fear that uprisings and mutinies might be approaching. To help
      defend themselves, all heads of staff have been given telescopic batons to subdue
      attackers should they be assaulted during their shifts.
  - bugfix: Toolbelts can now hold pocket fire extinguishers. Atmos technicians spawn
      with them.
  - rscadd: Remember those magboots we had our undercover agents steal? Well we've
      finally reverse engineered them. Not only that, but we gave them a killer paintjob.
      They will be available in the uplinks of boarding parties we send out to Nanoscum
      stations.
  - rscadd: Listen up, Marauders! The Syndicate has recently cut back funding into
      boarding parties. What this means is no more hi-tech fancy energy guns. We've
      had to roll back to using cheaper, mass-produced automatic shotguns. But in
      retrospect, could this possibly be a downgrade?
2014-10-08:
  Cheridan:
  - tweak: Flash mechanics changed. Instead of a knockdown effect, it will cause a
      stumbling effect. This includes area-flashing. The five-use-per-minute limit
      has been removed. "Synthetic" flashes made in the protolathe are now normal
      flashes.
  Paprika:
  - rscadd: Added a unique shield to the Head of Security's locker. It can be concealed
      for storage and activated like an energy shield, but functions like a riot shield.
      It can also be made at the protolathe.
  - rscadd: 'Marauders: Due to your extremely great performance as of late, we''ve
      added a new equipment room on Mother Base. A lot of your equipment has been
      moved to this room, as well as some new equipment added onto the Mothership.
      Take some extra time to familiarize yourself with the placement of your equipment.'
  - rscadd: Oh, and you guys have a space carp now too.
  Paprka:
  - rscadd: Added jumpsuit adjusting. Adjust your jumpsuit to wear it more casually
      by rolling it down or roll up those sleeves of that hard-worn suit!
  - rscadd: Added a grey alternative to the detective's suit and trenchcoat. Now you
      can be a noir private investigator!
  Tkdrg:
  - rscadd: Space Station 13 has been deployed with transit tube dispensers. Central
      Command encourages the engineering department to repair and improve the station
      using this equipment.
2014-10-09:
  Paprika:
  - rscadd: Added inaprovaline MediPens (autoinjectors) that replace inaprovaline
      syringes in medkits. Like the syringes, these can be used to stabilize patients
      in critical condition, but require no medical knowledge to use.
  - experiment: Reverted the mining scanner to a manual scanner.
  - bugfix: Buffed the rate of the automatic scanner
  - rscadd: Added automatic scanner to equipment locker. It is also available by redeeming
      your voucher.
  - bugfix: Reduced the size of the mining jetpack, it now fits in backpacks. The
      capacity of the jetpack has been reduced as well, however.
  - experiment: Removed resonator from the mining voucher redemption. Replaced it
      with a mining drill.
2014-10-19:
  Donkie:
  - rscadd: Major atmos update. Featuring pretty colors.
  - rscadd: 4-Way pipes added.
  - rscadd: Flip-able trinary devices (mixer &amp; filter).
  - rscadd: Pipe-painter added.
  - tweak: Most pipe icons have been tweaked with shading and such, making it look
      more uniform.
  JJRcop:
  - rscadd: We have managed to re-discover drones! We improved the formula, and have
      discovered some cool stuff.
  - rscadd: After some fiddling with audio recognition, drones can now understand
      human speech!
  - rscadd: One of our engineers found some screws that were loose on some of our
      tests, screwing them in made the drone work as if it had just come out of robotics.
  - tweak: We had to sacrifice some of our NT brand EMP protection for the speech
      recognition, so drones can get damaged if subjected to heavy EMP radiation.
  - bugfix: We figured out why drones couldn't remove objects from people, that has
      been fixed.
  - bugfix: The standby light wasn't wired correctly.
  - rscdel: Unfortunately one of our assistants tasked with transporting the only
      copy of the data dropped the flash drive in hot water because he wanted to see
      what "drone tea" tasted like. You'll have to discover them again.
  Lo6a4evskiy:
  - rscadd: Station's crayons have been upgraded to the version 2.0 of ColourOS. Don't
      worry, they are still edible!
  - tweak: Many items now have different stripping delays. Heavier and more armored
      pieces of clothing are generally more difficult to take off someone else, while
      smaller items can be very easy to snatch. Pockets always take 4 seconds to search.
  MrPerson:
  - rscadd: Implants are activated via action buttons on the top-left corner of your
      screen instead of emotes.
  Paprika:
  - rscadd: Added zipties for security and nuke operatives. These have a slightly
      shorter 'breakout time' as normal cuffs but they are destroyed upon removal.
      Beepsky and sec borgs now use these by default.
  - bugfix: Changed the medical HUD in the tactical medkit to a night vision HUD so
      syndicate medics don't stumble around in the dark. Can be purchased through
      nuke op uplinks.
  - rscadd: Added a second roboticist roundstart job slot.
  - rscadd: Added a third cargo tech job slot.
  Paprka:
  - rscadd: Added undershirts as a companion piece to jumpsuit adjusting. Beat the
      heat with a comfortable tank top, or warm up with an extra layer tshirt!
  - rscadd: Added a holographic sign projector to replace the old wet floor signs
      to encourage janitors to warn crewmembers about wet floors.
  optimumtact:
  - rscadd: Medical supplies crate now comes with a boxy full of bodybags
2014-10-27:
  Jordie0608:
  - rscadd: Adds a new riot shotgun that spawns in the armory with a 6 round beanbag
      magazine.
  Paprika:
  - experiment: Allowed constructs to assist in activating most runes. This includes
      conversion runes, but does NOT include sacrifice runes.
  Patchouli Knowledge:
  - rscadd: In light of the recent achievements of the Robotics department, new and
      upgraded exosuit schematics were delivered to SS13 exosuit fabricators as a
      reward from CentComm.
  - rscadd: The countless hours of research, experimentation, and reverse-engineering
      of wrecks from the mining asteroid have paid off - the Research team has rediscovered
      the process of building Phazon exosuits. The parts and circuits have been made
      available in the exofabs and circuit printers.
  - rscadd: The APLU Ripley exosuit has been refitted with asteroid mining purposes
      in mind. Its armour plating will provide extra protection against the brute
      attacks of asteroid alien lifeforms, and protect from gibtonite explosions.
      The leg servos were upgraded to provide faster movement.
  - rscadd: There are rumours of some creative shaft miners discovering a way of augmenting
      APLU Ripley armour with trophy hides from goliath-type asteroid lifeforms...
  - tweak: Durand construction routines now require a phasic scanner module and a
      super capacitor to match Nanotrasen industry standards.
  - tweak: The exosuit fire extinguisher now boasts a larger watertank, and carries
      a whole 1000u of water from the old 200u tank.
  - tweak: The exosuit plasma converter's efficiency has been vastly improved upon,
      and its fuel consumption has been cut to nearly half of old values.
  - bugfix: The exosuit sleeper interiors have been refitted to allow the occupants
      more freedom of movement, and the occupants may now eject at will.
  - bugfix: The armour plating on all exosuits was fitted with reactive deflection
      systems specifically designed to stop the rapid slashes from xenomorph threats.
  - bugfix: The Firefighter Ripley chassis were moved from the Exosuit Equipment section
      to the APLU Ripley section of exofab menus.
  - spellcheck: Fixed some minor errors in the exosuit construction message syntax.
  phil235:
  - rscadd: Closets and its children can no longer contain a near infinite amount
      of mobs. Large mobs (juggernaut, alien emperess, etc) don't fit, small mobs
      (mouse, parrot, etc) still fit in the same amounts, human-sized mob (humanoid,
      slime, etc) fit but maximum two per body bag and three for all the other closets.
      Adding bluespace body bag to R&amp;D, it can hold even large mobs and in large
      amounts.
  - experiment: girders and displaced girders now have a chance to let projectiles
      pass through them.
2014-10-30:
  MrPerson:
  - rscadd: Everything now drifts in space, not just mobs.
  - rscadd: Mechs are just as maneuverable in space as you are.
  - tweak: Being weightless now slows movement down by a lot rather than speeding
      it up. Having your hands full will make movement even slower.
  - rscdel: Removed spaceslipping (You slipped! x1000)
  - bugfix: Jetpacking after being thrown out a mass driver will cancel out your momentum.
  - bugfix: Shooting a gun causes you to drift the other direction like spraying a
      fire extinguisher.
2014-11-04:
  MrPerson:
  - rscadd: You can use AI Upload modules directly on unslaved cyborgs to change their
      laws. The panel has to be open to do this.
  - bugfix: Newly emagged cyborgs get locked down for a little bit until their new
      laws get shown. Thank you to whoever bitched about it on singulo and filed an
      issue report.
  Paprika:
  - rscadd: Added an advanced mop for the janitor, available at the protolathe. This
      hi-tech custodian's friend can mop twice as many floor tiles before needing
      to return to your bucket!
  - tweak: Moved holosign projector to the protolathe and gave the janitor back his
      old signs. We hope you've enjoyed this free trial run of holo projectors, but
      our budget is tight!
  - rscadd: Added a holosign projector to the janitor module for cyborgs.
  - tweak: Soap now has a delay. Different soap types clean faster than others, but
      expect to put it some extra arm work if you want to clean that fresh blood!
  Tkdrg:
  - rscadd: Cutting-edge research in a secret Nanotransen lab has shed light into
      a revolutionary form of communication technology known as 'chat'. The Personal
      Data Assistants of Space Station 13 have been deployed with an experimental
      module implementing this system, dubbed 'Nanotransen Relay Chat'.
2014-11-10:
  Menshin:
  - tweak: Made meteors more threatening.
  - rscadd: Added three levels of danger for meteors waves, randomly selected at spawn.
  - rscadd: Rumors speaks of a very rare meteor of unfathomable destructive power
      in the station sector...
  - bugfix: Fixed infinigib/infinisplosion with meteors bumping
  Paprika:
  - rscadd: Added a defibrillator and an EMT alternative clothing set for medical
      doctors. These defibrillators will revive the recently deceased as long as their
      souls are occupying their body and they have no outstanding brute or burn damage.
  - bugfix: Yes, they actually work now too!
  - rscadd: Added a way for you to unload a round from a chambered projectile weapon.
      Simply click on the gun when it is in your active hand, and assuming it does
      not have a magazine, the round should pop out. You can also use this system
      to unload individual bullets from magazines and ammo boxes, like the detective's
      speed loaders.
  - rscadd: Added glass tables and overhauled how table construction works. Now, you
      need to build a frame using either metal rods or wood planks, and then place
      a top on the table.
  - tweak: Table disassembly now works in two stages. Screwdriver the table to remove
      the top of it and reduce it back to a frame. Frames can be moved around and
      walked on top of. Wrench the table to deconstruct it entirely back to parts,
      this is quicker and much more like the old fashion. To deconstruct a frame,
      use your wrench on it as well.
  - bugfix: Fixed traitor med analyzers not fitting in medical belts.
  - bugfix: Fixed syringe box bug with medipens.
  Perakp:
  - rscadd: Added escape-with-identity objective for changelings. Completion requires
      the changeling to have transformed to their target and be wearing an ID card
      with the target's name on it when escaping.
  - tweak: Changelings can absorb someone even if they have that DNA in storage already.
  - bugfix: Fixes hivemind being lost when readapting evolutions.
2014-12-08:
  Ergovisavi:
  - rscadd: Allows using replica pods to clone people without bodies.
  - tweak: Speeds up replica pod cloning by adjusting the starting production.
  - tweak: Replica pods will now only create plantmen.
  - tweak: Mixing blood in a beaker or taking it from a suicide victim will render
      the blood sample useless for replica pod cloning.
  GunHog:
  - rscadd: Our top Nanotrasen scientists have provided improved specifications for
      the Rapid Part Exchange Device (RPED)! The RPED can now contain up to 50 machine
      components, and will display identical items in groups when using its inventory
      interface.
  - rscadd: Note that power cells, being somewhat bulkier, will take up more space
      inside the device. In addition, the RPED's firmware has also been updated to
      assist in new machine construction! Simply have the required components inside
      the RPED, apply it to an unfinished machine with its circuit board installed,
      and watch as the device does the work!
  - rscadd: Nanotrasen has updated station bound Artificial Intelligence unit design
      specifications to include an integrated subspace radio transmitter. The transmitter
      is programmed with all standard department channels, along with the inclusion
      of its private channel. It is accessed using :o in its interface.
  - rscadd: '{INCOMING CLASSIFIED SYNDICATE TRANSMISSION} Greetings, agents! Today,
      we are happy to announce that we have successfully reverse engineered the new
      subspace radio found in Nanotrasen''s newest AI build plans. We have included
      our encryption data into these transmitters.'
  - rscadd: Should you be deployed with one of our agent AIs, it may be wise of you
      to purchase a syndicate encryption key in order to contact it securely. Remember,
      as with other agents, a Syndicate AI is unlikely to be of the same Syndicate
      corporation as you, and you both may actually have conflicting mission parameters!
      Your channel, as always, is accessed using :t.
  Paprika:
  - tweak: Changed the way flashbang protection works. Currently, only security helmets
      (and their derivatives like swat and riot), and some hardsuit helmets have flashbang
      protection. Ear items like earmuffs and 'bowman' headsets (alternative, larger
      headsets) have flashbang protection as well, so you're able to go hatless as
      security. The Head of security, warden, and detective's hat do NOT have flashbang
      protection, but their earpieces do, from the 'noise' part of the flashbang.
      The flashbang blind still works as before, with only sunglasses/hardsuit helmets
      protecting you.
  Tkdrg:
  - tweak: Security/Medical HUDs are now more responsive and less laggy.
2014-12-10:
  GunHog:
  - rscadd: The Nanotrasen firmware update 12.05.14 for station AI units and cyborgs
      includes a patch to give them more control of their automatic speech systems.
      They can now chose if the message should be broadcasted with their installed
      radio system and any frequency available to them.
  Paprika:
  - rscadd: Added winter coats and winter boots! Bundle up for space xmas! They are
      available in most wardrobe and job lockers, and come with special features depending
      on the flavor!
  Paprka:
  - rscadd: Added a new weapon for syndicate boarding parties, the C-90gl assault
      rifle. This is a hybrid rifle with a lot of damage and a grenade launcher alt-fire.
      Purchasable for 18TC.
  - tweak: Suppressors can now be used on the protolathe SMG and the C-20r.
  RemieRichards:
  - tweak: Sounds in areas of low pressure (E.g. Space) are now much quieter
  - tweak: To hear someone in space you need to be stood next to them, or use a radio
  as334:
  - rscadd: We've discovered that slimes react to the introduction of certain chemicals
      in their bloodstream. Inaprovaline will decrease the slimes children's chance
      of mutation, and plasma will increase it.
  - rscadd: We've also found that feeding slimes solid plasma bars makes them more
      friendly to humans.
2014-12-16:
  Paprika:
  - tweak: Reverted security armor and helmets to the old (Grey) style of armor/helmets.
  - tweak: Updated security jumpsuits to be more consistent across officer/warden/HoS
      ranks.
  - rscadd: Added tactical armor and helmets to replace the largely unused bulletproof
      vest in the armory. This armor has higher bullet and explosive resistance than
      normal armor, and uses the previous, more military armor/helmet sprites.
  - rscadd: Added a new injury doll to go along with the overall health meter. This
      will show you locational overall limb-based burn/brute damage, so you can tell
      the difference between being hurt with burn/brute or toxins/stamina damage which
      does not affect limbs.
  - tweak: Reverted some UI icons back to their older status and changed some around
      for readability. Thank you for your feedback.
  Thunder12345:
  - rscadd: Added a new FRAG-12 explosive shotgun shell, built from the unloaded technological
      shell, using tablecrafting. Constructed using an unloaded technological tech
      shell, 5 units sulphuric acid, 5 units polytrinic acid, 5 units glycerol, and
      requires a screwdriver.
  phil235:
  - rscadd: 'Change to the hunger system. Eating food with sugar temporarily worsens
      your nutrition drop rate. Eating too much sugar too quickly can make you temporarily
      unable to eat any sugary food. The nutritional effect of sugar depends on how
      hungry you are thus it cannot easily  raise your nutrition level past well fed
      and is best used when hungry. Lots of sugar can make you a bit jittery at times.
      Eating food with vitamin (new reagent) counteracts the sugar effects and can
      give you temporary buffs when well fed: it lowers your chance to catch or spread
      viruses,it makes your body''s metabolism more efficient that is it keeps healing
      reagents longer and evacuate toxins faster and reduces damage from radioactive
      reagents. Your metabolism gets less efficient if starving.'
  - rscadd: 'New hunger hud icons: starving, hungry, fed, well fed, full, fat.'
  - rscadd: Snack vending machine get a chef compartment that can be loaded with non-sugary
      food by hand or with a tray by anyone with kitchen access (unless you hack the
      machine with multitool or emag). The food can be unloaded by anyone, like regular
      snacks
  - rscadd: Cargo can get a nutritious pizza crate order for 60 points.
  - tweak: Grown and cooked food gets some vitamin while junk food gets less nutriment
      and more sugar (only hot donkpocket and ramen don't have sugar)
  - tweak: The number of junk food in snack vending machine is lowered from 6 to 5
      of each type.
  - bugfix: Fixing not being able to load an omelette du fromage on a tray.
2014-12-27:
  Dorsidwarf:
  - tweak: Buffs the RCD from 30 matter units to max capacity 100, and increases the
      value of matter charges.
  Paprika:
  - experiment: Taser electrodes now have a limited range of 7 tiles.
  - experiment: The energy gun's stun mode has been replaced with a disable mode.
  - experiment: Security officers will now spawn with tasers.
  - tweak: Disabler beams now go through windows and grilles.
  - tweak: Disabler beams now do 33 stamina damage instead of 34. This means they
      will only stun in 3 hits on someone that is NOT 100% healthy.
  - tweak: Most ballistic projectiles now do stamina damage in addition to their regular
      damage instead of stunning. This includes nuke op c-20r .45, detective's revolver,
      etc. They are effectively better than disablers at stunning people, as well
      as do significant damage, but they do not stun instantly like a taser. Expect
      engagements to be a little longer and plan ahead for this.
  - rscadd: Added an advanced taser for RnD, the child of a disabler and a taser.
  Tkdrg:
  - rscadd: Envoys from the distant Viji sector have brought an exotic contraption
      to Centcomm. Known as the 'supermatter shard', it is a fragment of an ancient
      alien artifact, believed to have a dangerous and mysterious power. This precious
      item has been made available to the Space Station 13 cargo team for the cost
      of a hundred supply points, as a reward for all your hard work. Good luck, and
      stay safe.

      reactions from taking place in  the container it is in, such as Smoke Powder
      and Flash Powder, allowing you to get the raw forms of the powders for heating
      up later.
  - rscadd: Smoke Powder and Flash Powder can now be mixed along with Stabilizing

      of someone.
  - rscadd: Adds Cryostylane.  This reagent does the opposite of Pyrosium, but it
      still requires oxygen to react with.
  - rscadd: Adds Phlogiston. This reagent ignites you and gives you a single fire
      stack every 3 seconds. Burn damage from this chemical scales up with the fire
      stacks you have. Counter this with literally any chemical that purges other
      chems.
  - experiment: Smoke now transfers reagents to the mob, and applies touch reactions
      on them. This means smoke can run out of reagents, no more infinite acid smoke.
      It also only works on mobs, use the new Reagent Foam(tm) for your hellfoam needs.
      I suggest a CLF3 Fluoroacid Black Powder mix.
  - experiment: Added a derelict medibot to the code, will place a few on the derelict

      cause 3-5 loss of breath. Get it from the traitor Poison Kit.

      your stamina. Get it from the traitor Poison Kit.

      it with Acetone, Diethylamine, and Sulfur.

      of TOX damage based on how long it's been in you. Get it from the traitor Poison
      Kit.
  - rscadd: Adds Lipolicide. +1 TOX unless you have nutriment in you. Mix it with
      Mercury, Diethylamine, and Ephedrine.
  - rscadd: Adds Coiine. +2 TOX and +5 loss of breath every 3 seconds. Get it from
      the traitor Poison Kit.
  - rscadd: Adds Curare. +1 TOX, +1 OXY, paralyzes after 33 seconds. Get it from the
      traitor Poison Kit.
  - rscadd: Adds a reagent_deleted() proc to reagents for effects upon the last time
      it processes in you, like with Amantin.

      not the minimum time between events.
  - rscdel: Departmental Uprising has been made admin only for being an RP heavy event
      that creates antags in an enviroment that doesn't really support that.

      they opt into. If they're selected they simply will not end up with an incompatible
      job.

      and had it set to high, and the only other jobs he had set were security officer
      at medium and botanist at low but he was selected to be a traitor, he would
      spawn as a botanist even if there ended up being no Head of Security.

      because it affected your antag chances.

      phylactery well, for he is immortal!

      phylactery item before they can ressurect to it. The more a lich is slain the

      crew is to catch him during a vunerable moment.
  - rscremove: Due to the addition of proper liching, skeletons as a choosable race

      is used for all the remaining calculations instead of Armour (Eg: 80 Melee -

      Using these spells will spawn a special touch weapon in a free hand (your dominant
      hand if possible) that can then be used to inflict the spell on the target of

      change. Clicking the spell while the hand is out will let you return the charge
      without using it.
  - rscdel: The spell won't begin to recharge until the hand attack is either used
      or returned. Additionally these changes mean you can no longer use these spells
      while stunned or handcuffed. As a suggestion remember that the mutate spell
      allows you to break out of cuffs very easily, and warping abilities will keep
      you from getting cuffed to begin with!

      be used to fuck with your sprite

      not incur this behavior.
  - tweak: In response to complaints about rogue drones, Nanotrasen engineers have
      allowed factory resets on all drones by simply using a wrench.
  - experiment: Central Command reminds drones to immediately retreat, if possible,
      when a law override is begun. Not doing so may anger the gods and incur their
      wrath!

      on your head.

      of biowaste products, such as slime extracts.

      use the reagent container's transfer amount instead (except for sprays which
      get 50u for faster refilling).

  - rscadd: 'Syndicate bomb payloads will now detonate if set on fire long enough.
      Note that the casings for the bombs is fireproof, so if you want to set fire
      to a bombcore you''ll need to remove it from the case first (cut all wires,
      then crowbar it out). A reassurance from our explosives department: it is, and
      always has been, impossible to detonate a syndicate bomb that isn''t ticking
      with wirecutters alone.'
  Xhuis:
  - rscadd: Geiger counters have been added and are obtainable from autolathes and
      EngiVends. They will measure the severity of radiation pulses while in your
      pockets, belt, or hands. One can scan a mob's radiation level by switching to
      Help intent and clicking on it. These counters never really discard the radiation
      they store, and rumor has it this can be used in nefarious ways...
  - tweak: When a mob is impacted by radiation, the radiation is now relayed to all
      items on the mob.

  Kor:
  - rscadd: The friendly gold slime reaction now spawns three mobs.
  phil235:
  - tweak: Changed the effects of alcohol to be more realistic. The effects of alcohol
      now appear twice as fast. Drunkenness now scales with how much alcohol is in
      you, not how long you've been drinking. This means drinking very little but
      continuously no longer makes you very drunk, or confused/slurring for a long
      time or give you alcohol poisoning. The dizziness and slurring effects now properly
      scale with how drunk you are (and dizziness is generally more pronounced).

  Incoming5643:
  - rscadd: The spell Charge has been added to the spellbook. It can be used to extend

  - tweak: Standardizes the slowdown of most spacesuits to 1 as opposed to 2.
  Incoming5643:
  - rscadd: 48x48 pixel mode (x1.5 zoom) has been added to the Icons menu (top left).
      While playing in 32x32 or 64x64 will still provide a clearer looking station,
      for those of us with resolutions that fall into the gap between the two zooms
      this can provide a more consistant looking station than stretch to fit.
  - rscadd: 96x96 pixel mode (x3 zoom) has also been added for our players who enjoy
      looking at spacemen on their 4k monitors at a crisp and consistent scale.
  - tweak: The lich spell has been subjected to some gentle nerfing. When you die
      a string of energy will tie your new body to your old body for a short time,
      aiding others in determining your location. The duration of this beam scales
      with the number of deaths you've avoided.
  - tweak: Additionally the post revival stun now also scales in this way.
  - tweak: The spell will also fail if the item and the wizard don't share the same
      z level, though the nature of space means the odds of the item (or the wizard)
      looping around back to the station is pretty high.
  - rscadd: The spell is still really good.

  Joan:
  - bugfix: You can now click on things under timestop effects, instead of clicking
      the effect and looking like a fool.

      the game preferences verb in the preferences tab
  - rscadd: The round end restart delay can now be configured by server operators.

      (jobs only) or the medHUD of humans.

      saving some annoying inventory shuffle at roundstart.

  Incoming5643:
  - rscadd: Slimepeople can now split if they contain 200 units of slime jelly, and
      slimepeople will now slowly generate slime jelly up to 200 units provided they
      are very well fed. Split slimepeople are NOT player controlled, but rather the
      original slime person can swap between the two mobs at will. If one of the slimepeople
      should die under player control, the player won't be able to swap back to their
      living body. Splitting only creates a new body, any items you have on you are
      not duplicated.
  - rscadd: Slimepeople now take half damage from sources of heat, but double damage
      from sources of cold. Lasers good, Space bad.

  Gun Hog:
  - rscadd: Nanotrasen listens! After numerous complaints and petitions from Security
      personnel regarding energy weapon upkeep, we have authorized the construction
      and maintenance of your station's weapon rechargers. As an added bonus, we have
      also provided a more modular design for the devices, allowing for greater recharge
      rates if fitted with a more efficient capacitor!
  - rscadd: Added Diagnostic HUDs! They can be used to view the health and cell status
      of borgs and mechs. Silicons have them built in, Roboticists get two in their
      locker, and the RD's hardsuit has one built in.
  Incoming5643:
  - rscadd: The number of roundstart head revolutionaries nows depends on the roundstart
      security force as well as the roundstart heads
  - rscadd: The maximum number of head revs is 3, the minimum is 1. If there is fewer
      than three station heads there will never be more than that number of head revs
      at roundstart. For every three vacant security roles (Head of Security/Warden/Security
      Officer/Detective) at roundstart the number of starting head revs will be reduced
      by 1.
  - rscadd: Head revolutionaries can be gained during play if the security/head roles
      are filled. They are drawn from existing revolutionaries.
  - rscadd: Added dental implant surgery. While targeting the mouth drill a hole in
      a tooth then stick a pill in there for hands free later use.

      of blueprints that will allow you to expand the territory your camera can cover.
  Kor and Remie:
  - rscadd: Added as series of laser reflector structures, the frame of which can
      be built with 5 metal sheets.
  - rscadd: Completing the frame with 5 glass sheets creates a mirror that will reflect
      lasers at a 90 degree angle.
  - rscadd: Completing the frame with 10 reinforced glass sheets creates a double
      sided mirror that reflects lasers at a 90 degree angle.

      easier.

      by dragging the target away.

      cast.
  - tweak: Malfunction now affects non-machine objects, even if they're not being
      held by a human.

      things.

  - experiment: A number of popular stunning spells have undergone balance changes.
      Note that for the most part the stuns themselves are untouched.
  - experiment: 'Lightning Bolt Changes:'
  - rscdel: You can no longer throw the bolt whenever you want, it will fire itself
      once it's done charging.
  - rscadd: Getting hit by a bolt will do a flat 30 burn now, as opposed to scaling
      with how long the wizard spent charging the spell. Unless said wizard made a
      habit of charging lightning bolt to near maximum every time this is a buff to
      damage.
  - rscdel: Every time the bolt jumps the next shock will do five less burn damage.
  - rscadd: Lightning bolts can still jump back to the same body, so the maximum number
      of bolts you can be hit by in a single casting is three, and the maximum amount
      of damage you could take for that is 60 burn.

  - rscdel: Cooldown raised to 20 seconds, up from 15

      from 9, and is effectively a permastun.

      not opening right away.
  PKPenguin321:
  - rscadd: Teleprods can now be constructed. Make them via tablecrafting, or by putting
      a bluespace crystal onto a stunprod. They warp the target to a random nearby

      victim a brief stun. Like stunprods, they require a power cell to function.

      sets people on fire instead of turning them into a light show.

      dragonsbreath round.

      walls around the camera. On the other hand, cameras with an xray upgrade let

      by brute damage in melee.

      the 'blob' faction, such as blobbernauts and spores.

      balls. First ball comes with 32 energy (down from 300), fourth requires 256

      7 are increasingly harder to get than before, whereas balls before 6 are easier
      to get.
  - rscadd: MULTIBOLT IS BACK!
  - tweak: Be warned that in multibolt all but 1 primary bolt now have a random shocking

      twice the power of a stage 3 singulo with maxed collectors without any balls,

      corpse and cloned, but deffibing the corpse always fails (can't revive someone

  - wip: This only works with the default white ghost form right now (because the

      bodies since they're the only ones that have hair. Sorry lizards and plasmamen!
      You'll get your turn next time.
  - rscadd: A new preference called Ghost Accessories. This lets you configure if
      you want your ghost sprite to show both hair and directional sprites, only directional
      sprites or just use its original default version without directional sprites.
  - rscadd: 'A new preference called Ghosts of Others. This preference is clientside
      and lets you configure how other ghosts appear to you: as their own setting,
      as the form they chose but without any hair or directional sprites, or as the
      simple white ghost sprite if you''re sick of those premium users with their
      rainbow ghosts.'
  - experiment: The layout of the ghost preference buttons has slightly changed. The
      old Choose Ghost Form and Choose Ghost Orbit are now a part of Ghost Customization,
      which also contains the new Ghost Accessories button. Clicking Ghost Customization
      will send you directly to Ghost Accessories if you don't have premium. The Preferences
      tab now also contains the Ghost Display button, which lets you configure how
      other ghosts appear to you.
  - bugfix: Fixed a bug where the toggles for Ghost Accessories and Ghosts of Others
      in the Preferences menu wouldn't save your preference update to your save file.
  - bugfix: Renamed the "Ghost Display Settings" preference toggle button to "Ghosts

      long, regardless of whether it was 1u, or 100u) There is a limit, however, and
      you can't stack infinite lube.

      will boil away instantly.

  phil235:
  - tweak: Pull and Grab are merged together. Pulling stays unchanged. Using an empty
      hand with grab intent on a mob will pull them. Using an empty hand with grab
      intent on a mob that you're already pulling will try to upgrade your grip to
      aggressive grab>neck grab>kill grab. Aggressive grabs no longer stun you, but

      you escape the grip. You can break free from the grip by trying to move or using
      the resist button.

      also notify the medical channel if the clone dies or is horribly mutilated;
      but not if it is ejected early by authorised medical personnel.
  - rscadd: Cloning pods now are more capable of cloning humanoid species that do
      not breathe.
  - bugfix: You can only be damaged once by a shuttle's arrival. It is still unpleasant
      to be in the path of one though; try to avoid it.
  - rscadd: Adds Asteroid emergency shuttle to shuttle templates. It is a very oddly
      shaped one though, it might not be compatible with all stations.
  - rscdel: The Chaplain soulshard can only turn a body into a shade once. A released
      shade can still be reabsorbed by the stone to heal it.
  - rscadd: The shuttle manipulator now has a Fast Travel button, for those admins
      that really want a shuttle to get to where its going FAST.

  MrStonedOne:
  - bugfix: fixes see_darkness improperly hiding ghosts in certain cases.
  Xhuis:
  - tweak: Clockwork marauders can now smash walls and tables.
  - tweak: Servants are no longer turned into harvesters by Nar-Sie but instead take
      heavy brute damage and begin to bleed. Similarly, cultists are no longer converted
      by Ratvar but instead take heavy fire damage and are set ablaze.
  - rscadd: Added clockwork reclaimers. Ghosts can now click on Ratvar to become clockwork
      reclaimers - small constructs capable of forcefully converting those that still
      resist Ratvar's reign. Alt-clicking a valid target will allow the reclaimer
      to leap onto the head of any non-servant, latching onto their head and converting
      the target if they are able. The target will be outfitted with an unremovable,
      acid-proof hat version of the reclaimer. The reclaimer will be able to speak
      as normal and attack its host and anything nearby. If the reclaimer's host goes
      unconscious or dies, it will leap free.
  - rscadd: Added pinion airlocks. These airlocks can only be opened by servants and
      conventional deconstruction will not work on them. They can be created by proselytizing
      a normal airlock or from Ratvar.
  - rscadd: Added ratvarian windows. They are created when Ratvar twists the form
      of a normal window, and there are both single-direction and full-tile variants.
  - bugfix: Non-servants can no longer use clockwork proselytizers or mending motors.
  - bugfix: Servants are now deconverted properly.
  coiax:
  - bugfix: The cloning pod now sounds robotic on the radio.
  - rscadd: For extra observer drama, ghosts can now visibly see the countdown of
      syndicate bombs, nuclear devices, cloning pods, gang dominators and AI doomsday
      devices.
2016-06-05:
  Joan:
  - rscadd: Clockwork structures can be damaged by projectiles and simple animals,
      and will actually drop debris when destroyed.
  - rscadd: AIs and Cyborgs that serve Ratvar can control clockwork airlocks and clockwork
      windoors.
  - rscadd: The clockwork proselytizer can now proselytize windows, doors, grilles,
      and windoors.
  - rscadd: The clockwork proselytizer can proselytize wall gears and alloy shards
      to produce replicant alloy. It can also proselytize replicant alloy to refill,
      in addition to refilling by attacking it with alloy.
  - rscadd: The clockwork proselytizer can replace clockwork floors with clockwork
      walls and vice versa.
  - rscadd: Ratvar will convert windoors, tables, and computers in addition to everything
      else.
  - tweak: Ratvar now moves around much faster.
  - rscadd: Ratvar and Nar-Sie will break each other's objects.
  - tweak: The blind eye from a broken ocular warden now serves as a belligerent eye
      instead of as replicant alloy. The pinion lock from a deconstructed clockwork
      airlock now serves as a vanguard cogwheel instead of as replicant alloy.
  - rscadd: Clockwork walls drop a wall gear when removed by a welding tool. The wall
      gear is dense, but can be climbed over or unwrenched, and drops alloy shards
      when broken. Clockwork walls drop alloy shards when broken by other means.
  - bugfix: Fixed Nar-Sie wandering while battling Ratvar.
  - bugfix: Ratvarian Spears now last for the proper 5 minute duration.
  - bugfix: Servant communication now has ghost follow links.
  - imageadd: New sigil sprites, courtesy Skowron.
  - imageadd: Sigils of Transgression have a visual effect when stunning a target.
  - imageadd: Clockwork spears now have a visual effect when breaking.
  PKPenguin321:
  - rscadd: The CMO's medical HUD implant now comes with a one-use autoimplanter for
      ease of use.
  RemieRichards:
  - rscadd: Slimes may now be ordered to attack! You must be VERY good friends with
      the slime(s) to give this command, asking them to attack their friends or other
      slimes will result in them liking you less so be careful!
  X-TheDark:
  - rscadd: Mech battery replacement improved. The inserted battery's charge will
      be set to the same percentage of the removed one's (or 10%, if removed one's
      was less).
  coiax:
  - bugfix: Clicking the (F) link when an AI talks in binary chat will follow its
      camera eye, the same as when (F) is clicked for its radio chat.
  - bugfix: Laughter demons should now always let their friends go when asked correctly.
  - rscadd: Cloning pods now grab the clone's mind when the body is ejected, rather
      than when it starts cloning.
  - rscadd: Wizards have been experimenting with summoning the slightly less lethal
      "laughter demon". Please be aware that these demons appear to be nearly as dangerous
      as their slaughter cousins. But adorable, nonetheless.
  kevinz000:
  - rscadd: Gravity Guns! It is a mildly expensive R&D gun that has a 5 second cooldown
      between shots, but doesn't need to be recharged. It has two modes, attract and
      repulse. For all your gravity-manipulation needs!
2016-06-07:
  Bobylein:
  - rscadd: Nanotrasen is finally able to source transparent bottles for chemistry.
  Iamgoofball:
  - experiment: The Greytide Virus got some teeth.
  Joan:
  - wip: This is a bunch of Clockwork Cult changes.
  - rscadd: Added the Clockwork Obelisk, an Application scripture that produces a
      clockwork obelisk, which can Hierophant Broadcast a large message to all servants
      or open a Spatial Gateway with 5 uses and a 10 second duration to any conscious
      servant or clockwork obelisk.
  - wip: Spatial Gateways of any source have doubled uses and duration when the target
      is a clockwork obelisk.
  - rscadd: Added the Mania Motor, an Application scripture that produces a mania
      motor, which, while active, causes hallucinations and brain damage in all nearby
      humans.
  - wip: The Mania Motor will try to convert any non-servant human directly adjacent
      to it at an additional power cost and will remove brain damage, hallucinations,
      and the druggy effect from servants.
  - rscadd: Added the Vitality Matrix, an Application scripture that produces a sigil
      that will slowly drain health from non-servants that remain on it. Servants
      that remain on the sigil will instead be healed with the vitality drained from
      non-servants.
  - wip: The Vitality Matrix can revive dead servants for a cost of 25 vitality plus
      all non-oxygen damage the servant has. If it cannot immediately revive a servant,
      it will still heal their corpse.
  - experiment: Most clockwork structures, including the Mending Motor, Interdiction
      Lens, and the newly added Clockwork Obelisk and Mania Motor, now require power
      to function.
  - wip: Mending Motors can still use alloy for power.
  - tweak: The Sigil of Transmission has been remade into a power battery and will
      power directly adjecent clockwork structures. Sigils of Transmission start off
      with 4000 power and can be recharged with Volt Void.
  - tweak: Volt Void drains somewhat more power, but will not damage the invoker unless
      they drain too much power. Invokers with augmented limbs will instead have those
      limbs healed unless they drain especially massive amounts of power.
  - wip: Using Volt Void on top of a Sigil of Transmission will transfer most of the
      power drained to the Sigil of Transmission, effectively making it far less likely
      to damage the invoker.
  - rscdel: You can no longer stack most sigils and clockwork objects with themself.
      You can still have multiple different objects or sigils on a tile, however.
  - tweak: The Break Will Script has been renamed to Dementia Doctrine, is slightly
      faster, and causes slightly more brain damage.
  - tweak: The Judicial Visor now uses an action button instead of alt-click. Cultists
      of Nar-Sie judged by the visor will be stunned for half duration, but will be
      set on fire.
  - tweak: Multiple scriptures have had their component requirements changed. The
      Summon Judicial Visor Script has been reduced from a Script to a Driver.
  - rscadd: Recollection will now show both required and consumed components.
  - tweak: Clockwork Marauders can now emerge from their host if their host is at
      or below 60% total health(for humans, this is 20 health out of crit)
  - tweak: Clockwork Marauders will slowly heal if directly adjacent to their host
      and have a slightly larger threshold for their no-Fatigue bonus damage.
  Quiltyquilty:
  - rscadd: Botany, atmospherics and cargo now all have access to high-capacity watertanks.
  - rscadd: The bar has now been outfitted with custom bar stools.
  Xhuis:
  - rscdel: Removed the global message played when Nar-Sie _begins_ to spawn (but
      not when it actually spawns).
  - tweak: Drunkenness recovery speed now increases with how drunk the imbiber is
      and is much quicker when the imbiber is asleep.
  - tweak: Suit storage units now take three seconds to enter (up from one) and have
      different sounds and messages for UV ray cauterization.
  - bugfix: Fixed some bugs with the suit storage unit, inserting mobs, and contents
      to seemed to duplicate themselves.
  - bugfix: The Summon Nar-Sie rune can now only be drawn on original station tiles
      and fails to invoke if scribed on the station then moved elsewhere.
  coiax:
  - rscdel: Bluespace shelter capsules can no longer be used on shuttles.
  - rscadd: Bluespace shelters may have different capsules stored. View what your
      capsule has inside by examining it.
  - rscdel: The Nar'sie rune cannot be scribed on shuttles or off Z-level.
  - rscadd: The Raise Dead rune automatically grabs the ghost of the raised corpse.
  - rscadd: Deadchat is now notified when a sentient mob dies.
  phil235:
  - rscadd: Monkeys and all other animals that should have blood now has it. Beating
      them up will make you and your weapon bloody, just like beating a human does.
      Dragging them when wounded and lying will leave a blood trail. Their blood is
      still mostly cosmetic, they suffer no effects from low blood level, unlike humans.
  - rscadd: When a mob leaves a blood trail while dragged, it loses blood. You can
      no longer drag a corpse to make an inifinite amount of blood trails, because
      once the victim's blood reaches a certain threshold it no longer leaves a blood
      trail (and no longer lose any more blood). The threshold depends on how much
      damage the mob has taken. You can always avoid hurting the dragged mob by making
      them stand up or by buckling them to something or by putting them in a container.
  - rscdel: You can no longer empty a mob of its blood entirely with a syringe, once
      the mob's blood volume reaches a critically low level you are unable to draw
      any more blood from it.
  - tweak: A changeling absorbing a human now sucks all their blood.
2016-06-08:
  Cruix:
  - bugfix: Changelings no longer lose the regenerate ability if they respect while
      in regenerative stasis.
  Fox McCloud:
  - bugfix: Fixes Experimentor critical reactions not working
  - bugfix: Fixes Experimentor item cloning not working
  - bugfix: Fixes Experimentor producing coffee vending machines instead of coffe
      cups
  - tweak: Experimentor can only clone critical reaction items instead of anything
      with an origin tech
  GunHog:
  - rscadd: Nanotrasen has approved the Hyper-Kenetic Accelerator upgrade for cyborg
      mining modules.
  - tweak: Each of the heads' ID computers are now themed for their department!
  Joan:
  - tweak: Anima Fragments have slightly more health and move faster, but slow down
      temporarily when taking damage. Also they can move in space now.
  Kor:
  - rscadd: The clown will play a sad trombone noise upon death.
  - rscadd: Colossi now roam the wastes.
  - rscadd: Bubblegum now roams the wastes.
  PKPenguin321:
  - rscadd: You can now emag chemical dispensers, such as the ones in chemistry or
      the bar, to unlock illegal chemicals.
  lordpidey:
  - tweak: Infernal jaunt has been significantly nerfed with an enter and exit delay.
2016-06-09:
  GunHog:
  - rscadd: Nanotrasen scientists have completed a design for adapting mining cyborgs
      to the Lavaland Wastes in the form of anti-ash storm plating. Research for this
      technology must be adapted at your local station.
  Joan:
  - tweak: Anima Fragments have slightly less health and damage and will slow down
      for longer when hit.
  Kor:
  - rscadd: The captain now spawns with the station charter, which allows him to name
      the station.
  Papa Bones:
  - tweak: Loyalty implants have been refluffed to mindshield implants, they are mechanically
      the same.
  Xhuis:
  - rscadd: You can now remove all plants and weeds from a hydroponics tray by using
      a spade on it.
  - rscadd: Added meatwheat, a mutated variant of wheat that can be crushed into meat
      substitute.
  - rscadd: Added ambrosia gaia, a mysterious plant that is rumored to provide nutrients
      and water to any soil - hydroponic or otherwise - that it's planted in.
  - rscadd: Added cherry bombs, a mutated variant of blue cherries that have an explosively
      good taste. Oh, and don't pluck the stems.
  coiax:
  - tweak: The beacons from support guardians are now structures, rather than replacing
      the floor tile. In practice, this will change little, aside from not leaving
      empty plating when a beacon is removed because a new one has been placed.
  nullbear:
  - tweak: Removes the restriction on wormhole jaunters, preventing them from teleporting
      you to beacons on other z-levels.
  - tweak: No longer able to use beacons to bypass normal shuttle/centcomm anti-bluespace
      measures.
2016-06-11:
  Joan:
  - rscadd: Clockwork Slabs, Clockwork Caches near walls, and Tinkerer's Daemons will
      now be more likely to generate components that the clockwork cult has the least
      of.
  - rscadd: Destroyed Clockwork Caches will drop all Tinkerer's Daemons in them.
  - tweak: Clockwork Caches can now only generate a component every 30 seconds(when
      near a clockwork wall), Clockwork Slabs can only generate a component every
      40 seconds, and Tinkerer's Daemons can only generate a component every 20 seconds.
      This should result in higher component generation for everything except Clockwork
      Caches near clockwork walls.
  - tweak: Adding a component to a Clockwork Slab instead puts that component in the
      global component cache.
  - tweak: Clockwork Slabs only generate components if held by a mob or in a mob's
      storage, and when generating a component will prevent other Slabs held from
      generating a component.
  - tweak: The Replicant Driver no longer costs a Replicant Alloy to invoke; basically
      you can throw free Slabs at converts.
  - rscdel: Clockwork Slabs no longer have Repository as a menu option; instead, you
      can examine them to see how many components they have access to.
  - rscdel: Clockwork Caches directly on top of clockwork walls won't generate components
      from that wall.
  Lzimann:
  - rscadd: Bar stools are now constructable with metal!
  coiax:
  - rscadd: Ghosts are notified when someone arrives on the Arrivals Shuttle. This
      is independent of the announcement system, and the (F) link will follow the
      arrived person.
  - tweak: Slimes and aliens with custom names now retain those names when changing
      forms.
  kevinz000:
  - bugfix: Malf AI hacking an APC that is then destroyed will no longer bug the AI
  - bugfix: Being turned into a Revolutionary now stuns you for a short while.
  - bugfix: Kinetic Accelerators no longer drop their firing pin or cell when destroyed
      by lava
  phil235:
  - rscadd: Firelock assemblies can be reinforced with plasteel to construct heavy
      firelocks.
2016-06-12:
  Joan:
  - rscadd: Attacking a human you are pulling or have grabbed with a ratvarian spear
      will impale them, doing massive damage, stunning the target, and breaking the
      spear if they remain conscious after being attacked.
  - tweak: The Function Call verb is now an action button.
  Xhuis:
  - rscdel: While experimenting with floral genetic engineering, Nanotrasen botanists
      discovered an explosive variety of the cherry plant. Due to gross misuse, the
      genes used to produce this strain have been isolated and removed while Central
      Command decides how best to modify it.
  xxalpha:
  - rscadd: 'New wizard spell: Spacetime Distortion.'
  - rscadd: 3x1 grafitti
2016-06-13:
  Joan:
  - tweak: Sigils of Transgression will now only stun for about 5 seconds, from around
      10 seconds.
  - tweak: Sigils of Submission take about 5 seconds to convert a target, from around
      3 seconds, and will glow faintly.
  - rscadd: Sigils of any type can be attacked with an open hand to destroy them,
      instead of requiring harm intent. Servants still require harm intent to do so.
  Lati:
  - rscadd: Nanotrasen has added one of their rare machine prototypes to cargo's selection.
      It might be valuable to research.
  Xhuis:
  - rscadd: You can now create living cake/cat hybrids through a slightly expensive
      crafting recipe. These "caks" are remarkably resilient, quickly regenerating
      any brute damage dealt, and can be attacked on harm intent to take a bite to
      be fed by a small amount. They serve as mobile sources of food and make great
      pets.
  - rscadd: If a brain occupied by a player is used in the crafting recipe for caks,
      that player then takes control of the cak!
2016-06-14:
  Joan:
  - tweak: The Gateway to the Celestial Derelict now takes exactly 5 minutes to successfully
      summon Ratvar and has 500 health, from 1000.
  - rscadd: You can now actually hit people adjacent to the Gateway; only the center
      of the Gateway can be attacked. The Gateway is also now dense, allowing you
      to more easily shoot at it.
  - rscadd: All Scripture in the Clockwork Slab's recital has a simple description.
  Razharas:
  - rscadd: Wiki now has the method of cultivating kudzu vines that was in game for
      over a year. https://tgstation13.org/wiki/Guide_to_hydroponics#Kudzu
  kevinz000:
  - tweak: Gravity Guns should no longer destroy local reality when set to attract
      and shot in an east cardinal direction. Added safety checks has slightly increased
      the cost of the gun's fabrication. Nanotrasen apologizes for the inconvenience.
  - bugfix: Gravity guns now have an inhand sprite.
2016-06-16:
  GunHog:
  - rscadd: In response to alarmingly high mining cyborg losses, Nanotrasen has equipped
      the units with an internal positioning beacon, as standard within the module.
  Joan:
  - rscadd: You can now strike a Tinkerer's Cache with a Clockwork Proselytizer to
      refill the Proselytizer from the global component cache.
  - tweak: The Clockwork Proselytizer requires slightly less alloy to convert windows
      and windoors.
  - tweak: Several clockwork objects have more useful descriptions, most notably including
      structures, which will show a general health level to non-servants and exact
      health to servants.
  - imageadd: The Clockwork Proselytizer has new, more appropriate inhands.
  - tweak: Invoking Inath-Neq, the Resonant Cogwheel, now gives total invulnerability
      to all servants in range for 15 seconds instead of buffing maximum health.
  - tweak: Impaling a target with a ratvarian spear no longer breaks the spear.
  - tweak: Judicial Markers(the things spawned from Ratvar's Flame, in turn spawned
      from a Judicial Visor) explode one second faster.
  - rscdel: Removed Dementia Doctrine, replacing it with an Application sigil.
  - rscadd: Adds the Sigil of Accession, the previously-mentioned Application sigil,
      which is much like a Sigil of Submission, except it isn't removed on converting
      un-mindshielded targets and will disappear after converting a mindshielded target.
  - tweak: Sigil of Submission is now a Script instead of a Driver; It's unlocked
      one tier up, so you have to rely on the Drivers you have until you get Scripts,
      instead of spamming both Driver sigils for free converts.
  - rscadd: To replace Sigil of Submission in the Driver tier; Added Taunting Tirade,
      which is a chanted scripture with a very fast invocation, which, on chanting,
      confuses, dizzies, and briefly stuns nearby non-servants and allows the invoker
      a brief time to relocate before continuing the chant.
  - rscadd: Ghosts can now see the Gateway to the Celestial Derelict's remaining time
      as a countdown.
  - tweak: Anima Fragments are now slightly slower if not at maximum health and no
      longer drop a soul vessel when destroyed.
  Quiltyquilty:
  - rscdel: Patches now hold only 40u.
  - rscdel: Patches in first aid kits now only contain 20u of chemicals.
  coiax:
  - rscadd: Polymorphed mobs now have the same name, and where possible, the same
      equipment as their previous form.
2016-06-19:
  Joan:
  - tweak: Assassin holoparasite attack damage increased from 13 to 15, stealth cooldown
      decreased from 20 seconds to 16 seconds.
  - tweak: Charger holoparasite charge cooldown decreased from 5 seconds to 4 seconds.
  - tweak: Chaos holoparasite attack damage decreased from 10 to 7, range decreased
      from 10 to 7.
  - tweak: Lightning holoparasite attack damage increased from 5 to 7, chain damage
      increased by 33%.
  - rscdel: Clock cult scripture unlock now only counts humans and silicons.
  - rscadd: Servants of ratvar can now create cogscarab shells with a Script scripture.
      Adding a soul vessel to one will produce a small, drone-like being with an inbuilt
      proselytizer and tools.
  - imageadd: Clockwork mobs have their own speechbubble icons.
  - tweak: Invoking Sevtug now causes massive hallucinations, brain damage, confusion,
      and dizziness for all non-servant humans on the same zlevel as the invoker.
  - rscdel: Invoking Sevtug is no longer mind control. RIP mind control 2016-2016.
  - tweak: Clockwork slabs now produce a component every 50 seconds, from 40, Tinkerer's
      Caches now produce(if near a clockwork wall) a component every 35 seconds, from
      30.
  - experiment: 'Tinkerer''s daemons have a slightly higher cooldown for each component
      of the type they chose to produce that''s already in the cache: This is very
      slight, but it''ll add up if you have a lot of one component type and are trying
      to get more of it with daemons; 5 of a component type will add a second of delay.'
  Kor and Iamgoofball:
  - rscadd: Miners can now purchase fulton extraction packs.
  - rscadd: Miners can now purchase fulton medivac packs.
  - rscadd: Two new fulton related bundles are available for purchase with vouchers.
  Quiltyquilty:
  - rscadd: Beepsky now has his own home in the labor shuttle room.
  Wizard's Federation:
  - bugfix: We've fired the old Pope, who was actually an apprentice in disguise.
      We've a-pope-riately replaced him with a much more experienced magic user.
  - rscadd: Some less-then-sane people have been sighted forming mysterious cults
      in lieu of recent Pope sightings, lashing out at anyone who speaks ill of him.
  - bugfix: We've rejiggered our trans-dimensional rifts, and almost all cases of
      clergy members being flung into nothingness should be resolved.
  - bugfix: All members of the Space Wizard's Clergy have been appropriately warned
      about usage of skin-to-stone spells, and such there should be no more instances
      of permanent statueification.
  Xhuis:
  - tweak: Revenants have been renamed to umbras and have undergone some tweaks.
  coiax:
  - rscadd: Drones can hear robotic talk, but cannot communicate on it. AIs and cyborgs
      are encouraged to share information with station repair drones.
  - rscadd: Potted plants can now be ordered from cargo.
  - rscdel: AI turrets no longer fire at drones.
2016-06-20:
  Kor:
  - rscadd: Cult runes can only be scribed on station and on mining.
  - rscadd: The comms console now has a new option allowing you to communicate with
      the other server.
  Quiltyquilty:
  - rscadd: The detective has been moved to above the post office.
  coiax:
  - rscadd: Birdboat's supply loop has been split into two unconnected halves, to
      maintain award winning air quality.
  incoming5643:
  - experiment: New abilities for some races!
  - rscadd: Skeletons (liches) and zombies now are much more susceptible to limb loss,
      but can also reattach lost limbs manually without surgery.
  - rscadd: Slimepeople can now lose their limbs, but also can regenerate them if
      they have the jelly for it. Additionally slimepeople will (involuntarily) lose
      limbs and convert them to slime jelly if they're extremely low on jelly.
  - rscadd: Zombies and slimepeople now have reversed toxic damage, what usually heals
      now hurts and what usually hurts now heals. Keep in mind that while you could
      for example heal with unstable mutagen, you'd still mutate. Beware of secondary
      effects! Drugs like antitoxin are especially dangerous to these races now since
      not only do they do toxin damage, but they remove other toxic chems before they
      can heal you. Be wary also of wide band healing drugs like omnizine.
  - rscadd: For slime people the above mechanic also adds/drains slime jelly. So yes
      inhaling plasma is now a valid way to build jelly (but you'll still suffocate
      if there's no oxygen).
  - rscadd: Pod people now mutate if shot with the mutation setting of the floral
      somatoray.
2016-06-22:

      causing them to become confused and unequip their current module.
  Joan:
  - rscdel: Those who do not serve Ratvar cannot understand His creations.
  - rscadd: You can now repair clockwork structures with a clockwork proselytizer.
      This is about a third as efficient as a mending motor, costing 2 liquified alloy

      and plasteel.
  - rscadd: They can also directly convert rods to alloy.

      ruins have been cleaned up to not have atmos active turfs.
2016-06-24:
  Joan:
  - experiment: The Interdiction Lens has been reworked; instead of allowing you to
      disable Telecomms, Cameras, or non-Servant Cyborgs, it drains power from all
      APCs, SMES units, and non-Servant cyborgs in a relatively large area, funneling
      that power into nearby Sigils of Transmission, then disables all cameras and

      off for 2 minutes.

      fighting excessive amounts, they'll be forced to return to their host before
      they'd normally die.

      massively increase the damage they take, making it much more likely the marauder
      can be killed.
  - tweak: Clockwork Marauders do slightly less damage at low fatigue levels.
  - rscadd: Clockwork Marauders now have a chance to block melee attacks, negating
      the damage from them, and an additional chance to immediately counter, attacking

  - wip: If Ratvar has awoken, Marauders have a much higher chance to block and counter,
      will block thrown items and projectiles, and gradually regenerate.

      an acid puddle puts acid on your shoes or burns your bare feet. Picking up an

  - bugfix: The charge spell will no longer bilk you on wand charges, and wands that
      are dead won't show up as charged.

      damage, block slightly more often, and have to go slightly further from their

2017-01-02:
  MrStonedOne:

  - rscadd: Item throwing now imparts the momentum of the user throwing. Throwing
      in the direction you are moving throws the item faster, throwing away from the
      direction you are moving throws the item slower. This should make hitting yourself
      with floor tiles less likely.
  XDTM:
  - bugfix: Storage bags should now cause less lag when picking up large amounts of
      items.

  Nanotrasen Station Project Advisory Board:
  - wip: It is highly recommended that, when constructing the Meteor Shield project,

  Joan:
  - experiment: Clockwork Proselytizers no longer require Replicant Alloy to function;
      instead, they gradually charge themselves with power, which is used more or
      less the same as alloy.

      the gun while firing. It will cost gangs 50 influence.
  - rscadd: The sawn-off improvised shotgun is now available to gangs for 6 influence.
      With buckshot shells being easy to produce or purchase, this gun gives the most

      VERY sparingly, it deletes the block of the map and reloads it to roundstart.

      but its duration is halved if the binding is not being pulled by a Servant.

      to pull the binding. If you are pulling the binding, you can dispel it at any

      with a slab, not just the initiator.

      doppler array listening. The bombs have to have a theoretical radius far above
      maxcap to make a difference. You can only go up, not down, in radius, so you
      can't get 6 times the points with 6 TTVs. The algorithm is exponentially/logarithmically
      scaled to prevent "world destroyer" bombs from instantly finishing research.

      balancing in symptoms.
  - rscadd: Starlight Condensation heals toxin damage if you're in space using starlight
      as a catalyst. Being up to two tiles away also works, as long as you can still

      no exception.
  - rscadd: 'Cellular Molding heals brute damage depending on your body temperature:
      the higher the temperature, the faster the healing. Requires above-average temperature
      to activate, and the speed heavily increases while on fire.'
  - rscadd: Regenerative Coma (level 8) causes the virus to send you into a deep coma
      when you are heavily damaged (>70 brute+burn damage). While you are unconscious,
      either from the virus or from other sources, the virus will heal both brute
      and burn damage fairly quickly. Sleeping also works, but at reduced speed.
  - rscadd: Tissue Hydration heals burn damage if you are wet (negative fire stacks)
      or if you have water in your bloodstream.

      from the poisoning effects of plasma.
  - rscadd: Radioactive Resonance gives a mild constant brute and burn healing while
      irradiated. The healing becomes more intense if you reach higher levels of radiation,
      but is still less than the alternatives.
  - rscadd: Metabolic Boost (level 7) doubles the rate at which you process chemicals,
      good and bad, but also increases hunger tenfold.

      (usually after 10 minutes) or power is restored.
  - rscadd: You can override emergency light functionality from an APC. You can also
      click on individual lights as a cyborg or AI to override them individually.

  - bugfix: You can use control to turn using wasd and the numpad instead of just
      the arrow keys.
  - rscdel: 'Some old non-hotkey mode behaviors, especially in relation to chatbox
      interaction, can''t be kept with the new system. Of key note: You can''t type
      while walking. This is due to limitations of byond and the work necessary to
      overcome it is better done as another overhaul allowing custom controls.'
  Robustin:
  - rscdel: Reverted changes in 3d sound system that tripled the distance that sound
      would carry.

  XDTM:
  - rscadd: 'Brain damage has been completely reworked! remove: Brain damage now no
      longer simply makes you dumb. Although most of its effects have been shifted
      into a brain trauma.'
  - rscadd: Every time you take brain damage, there's a chance you'll suffer a brain
      trauma. There are many variations of brain traumas, split in mild, severe, and
      special.
  - rscadd: Mild brain traumas are the easiest to get, can be lightly to moderately
      annoying, and can be cured with mannitol and time.
  - rscadd: Severe brain traumas are much rarer and require extensive brain damage
      before you have a chance to get them; they are usually very debilitating. Unlike
      mild traumas, they require surgery to cure. A new surgery procedure has been
      added for this, the aptly named Brain Surgery. It can also heal minor traumas.
  - rscadd: 'Special brain traumas are rarely gained in place of Severe traumas: they
      are either complex or beneficial. However, they are also even easier to cure
      than mild traumas, which means that keeping these will usually mean keeping
      a mild trauma along with it.'
  - rscadd: Mobs can only naturally have one mild trauma and one severe or special
      trauma.
  - balance: Brain damage will now kill and ruin the brain if it goes above 200. If
      it somehow goes above 400, the brain will melt and be destroyed completely.
  - balance: Many brain-damaging effects have been given a damage cap, making them
      non-lethal.
  - rscdel: The Unintelligible mutation has been removed and made into a brain trauma.
  - rscdel: Brain damage no longer makes using machines a living hell.
  - rscadd: Abductors give minor traumas to people they experiment on.

      Anything they say is heard over the Hierophant network, and they can issue commands
      by middle-clicking themselves or different turfs.
  - rscadd: The Eminence also has a single-use mass recall that warps all servants
      to the Ark chamber.
  - rscadd: Added traps, triggers, and brass filaments to link them. They can all
      be constructed from brass sheets, and do different things and trigger in different
      ways. Current traps include the brass skewer and steam vent, and triggers include
      the pressure sensor, lever, and repeater.
  - rscadd: The Eminence can activate trap triggers by clicking on them!
  - rscadd: Servants can deconstruct traps instantly with a wrench.

      yellow scriptures are for construction, red for offense, blue for defense, and
      purple for niche.
  - balance: Servants now spawn with a PDA and black shoes to make disguise more feasible.
  - balance: The Eminence can superheat up to 20 clockwork walls at a time. Superheated
      walls are immune to hulk and mech punches, but can still be broken conventionally.

      taking an extra second less.
  - bugfix: Poly no longer continually undergoes binary fission when Ratvar is in
      range.

  deathride58:

      range is 21x15. Do note that changing this value will affect the title screen.
      The title screen images and the title screen area on the Centcom z-level will

      stay warm but going unprotected will help you cool off. However, you will now
      benefit from colder temps when you're overheating even in full EVA/hardsuit

      Shotgun slugs, .357 rounds, and other high damage projectiles will instantly
      shatter it and briefly stun the holder.'
  - balance: Nar'sien Bolas will not longer ensnare cultists and non-cultists will
      ensnare themselves when attempting to use them. The bolas are now comparable
      in effectiveness with reinforced bolas.
  - rscadd: Rune of Spirits. This merges the Spirit Sight and Manifest Ghost rune.
      The user will now choose which effect when invoking.
  - rscadd: The Spirit Sight function has received several major improvements, allowing
      the ghost to commune with the cult and mark objects similar how the cult master

      can see ghosts as well - allowing their summoner to lead them from the spirit
      realm.
  - balance: The Form Barrier rune will now last significantly longer and examining
      the rune as a cultist will tell you how long it will remain.
  - rscadd: The Apocalypse Rune. Replaces the EMP runes. Has a fixed invoker requirement

      to the cult. Effect includes a massive EMP, unique hallucination for non-cultists,
      and if the cult is doing poorly, certain events. The rune can only occur in
      the Nar-Sie ritual sites and will prevent Nar-Sie from being summoned there

  - balance: The "Construction" spell will now convert airlocks into cult airlocks
      and cyborgs (after ~10 seconds) into constructs. The airlock is the most fragile
      in the game, with reduced integrity, armor, and render it vulnerable to most
      attacks. Cyborg "reconstruction" will be accompanied by an obvious effect/sound.
  - rscadd: Blood Rites. This spell allows you to absorb blood from your surroundings
      or adjacent non-cultists. You can use the blood rites as a convenient heal (self-healing
      is significantly more costly though) or you can try to gather large quantities
      of blood for unique and powerful relics.
  - rscadd: Blood spear, a fragile but robust spear with a special recall ability
  - rscadd: Blood bolts, the cultist's version of arcane barrage. The bolts will infuse
      cultists with unholy water and damage anything else.
  - rscadd: Blood beam, the ultimate blood rite. After a channeling period it will
      fire 12 powerful beams across a long distance, piercing almost any surface (except
      blessed turf), and damaging all non-cult life caught in the beam.

      ratio was reduced to 20% to compensate for the increased volume and damage.

  - rscadd: Artificers, Wraiths and Juggernauts can now scribe revive, teleport, and
      barrier runes respectively with a 3 minute cooldown.

      Juggernauts got a modest speed increase (2.5 from 3) but lost a modest amount
      of HP (200 from 250).
  - rscadd: Juggernauts now get a ranged attack "Gauntlet Echo", a single projectile
      that moves about as fast as them and does 30 damage with 5 seconds of stun and
      a 35s cooldown.
  - balance: The number of ghosts summonable by the manifest spirit rune is 3, down
      from 5.
  - balance: It now takes ~20% less water (~25 units) and ~30 seconds less to deconvert

      it, to avoid incidents where people instantly wipe a critical rune by accident.

      be destroyed with most respectable melee weapons (10+).
  - balance: Teleporter runes that are used from space or lavaland will result in
      the destination rune giving off a unique effect for 60 seconds. This effect
      includes a long distance (but not obvious antagonistic) sound, a bright lighting
      effect, and a visual cue that will indicate where the cultist arrived from.

      force and resist of 100, and a pull force of 101. Things take (resist - force)
      damage when bumped into experimental; Failing to move onto a tile will now still
      bump up your last move timer. However, successfully pushing something out of
      your way will result in you automatically moving into where it was.'

  - rscadd: 'Several probably-inhuman creatures wielding psionic powers, known only
      as Hivemind Hosts, have appeared onboard the station and must assimilate as
      many crew members as possible. Assimilated crew serve as vessels for the Host
      to use their powers through (and on), and as a Host gains vessels, they gain
      new abilities. remove: Vessels are not antagonists. Assimilation does not convert
      crew in any way.'
  - rscadd: Assimilated crewmembers can escape this nightmare by either getting a
      mindshield implant or by dying. Mindshielding vessels will reveal the identity
      of whoever assimilated them. Mindshielded crew are initially protected, but
      should a Host get strong enough, they can break these implants with ease.
  - rscadd: Nothing is stopping Hosts from working together, but as their hives grow,
      so does the incentive to backstab. At 8 vessels, Hosts can probe the minds of
      crew and discover the identity of any other Hosts who have assimilated them,
      and at 18, they can steal every single vessel from a captured enemy Host.

      objectives have been removed from the mode.'

      especially at lower hive sizes.
  - balance: 'Induce Panic and Circadian Shift can affect silicons but no longer affect

      the baton can stun again.
  - tweak: Regular batons, e.g. telescopic, detective's, and contractor baton now

      more sane level and metabs 25% as fast as previous.
  - balance: The fiziver chem's damage-multiplying effect now gains potency at a much

      take 3x as much brute, burn, oxygen, and stamina damage as you normally would.
  - bugfix: The fiziver chem now properly undoes its modifications to the stamina_mod

  - balance: The fiziver chem's overdose effect is no longer incredibly pathetic.
      Instead of dealing a pitiful amount of damage and then completely purging the
      fiziver chem from your system, the fiziver chem's overdose effect now has a
      50% chance each tick to deal 0.2 brute damage and 0.2 burn damage (which will,
      of course, be amplified by the normal damage-increasing effect of fivizer).

  - bugfix: The plasma fixation symptom now correctly/actually heals you while you
      are standing in visible amounts of plasma gas.

      host's tile, in addition to its previous effect(s).

      now occur in both stage 4 and in stage 5 (instead of only in stage 5).

  ATH1909:
  - rscadd: The regenerative coma symptom has a new resistance 4 threshold effect!
      Said threshold effect will give hosts of the symptom's virus the TRAIT_STABLECRIT
      trait if its threshold is met.
  - bugfix: An obscure, probably never reported before bug that may or may not exist
      involving sentient diseases and the self-respiration symptom should be fixed
      now (if it even existed in the first place).
  ATHAHTH:
  - balance: Androids and synths have been added to the lists of races available from
      pride mirrors and magic mirrors.
  ATHATH:
  - tweak: The confusion symptom now noticeably confuses you.
  - tweak: The confusion symptom's transmission 6 threshold effect now actually affects

      a cap for how dizzy it can make you).
  - tweak: The dizziness symptom's transmission 6 threshold effect now makes your
      screen look "druggy" all of the time (only once its virus reaches a high enough
      stage, of course), instead of only occasionally.
  - tweak: The hallucigen symptom's stealth 4 threshold effect now continues to give
      you positive messages instead of bad ones at stage 5. Before this tweak, meeting
      that stealth threshold would actually cause bad messages to appear MORE often
      at stage 5 than if you hadn't met it.
  - tweak: Pretty much completely reworked the narcolepsy symptom so that it now uses
      the "drowsyness" (yes, that's how it's spelled in the code; no, I don't know
      why it's misspelled like that in the code) status effect instead of a confusing
      mess of ticking counters that rarely actually put you to sleep.
  - tweak: The narcolepsy symptom's transmission 7 threshold effect now only requires
      transmission 4 no longer causes its virus to occasionally deal negligible amounts
      of stamina damage. Instead, it now causes the host to periodically yawn, spreading
      its virus whenever they do so.
  - tweak: The narcolepsy symptom's resistance 10 threshold effect is now a stage
      speed 10 threshold effect.
  - tweak: The narcolepsy symptom's activation frequencies have been tweaked a bit

  ATHATH and ExcessiveUseOfCobblestone:
  - balance: Earthsblood's healing has been changed; its burn and brute healing rates
      have been increased, but its oxygen, stamina and clone healing rates have been
      lowered.
  - balance: Earthsblood heals you less before its 26th cycle in you, but also deals
      less brain damage to you before its 26th cycle in you as well.
  - balance: Earthsblood now gives you the pacifism trait temporarily while it is
      in your system.
  - balance: If you are a human, the earthsblood overdose effect now, in addition
      to its previous effects, gives you a pacifism brain trauma with a resilience
      of TRAUMA_RESILIENCE_SURGERY. If you already had a pacifism brain trauma with
      a resilience of TRAUMA_RESILIENCE_BASIC (for some reason), it will increase
      the resilience of that brain trauma to TRAUMA_RESILIENCE_SURGERY. This pacifism
      brain trauma is NOT taken away when the earthsblood chem leaves your system.
  - rscadd: After its 25th cycle in you, earthsblood has a 10% chance per tick of
      on_mob_life to make you say a random hippie-related message.

2019-09-10:
  ATHATH:
  - balance: The OD effect of the earthsblood chemical now deals no damage before
      cycle 26, a net 1 point of toxin damage per tick (factoring in the toxin healing
      from earthsblood's normal effect(s)) from cycles 26 to 100, and a net 3 points
      of toxin damage per tick (factoring in the toxin healing from earthsblood's
      normal effect(s)) after cycle 100.
  - bugfix: The pacifism trauma application part of OD effect of the earthsblood chemical
      is less shitcode-y now and should now work on monkeys (and other carbons with
      brains) too (instead of just on humans).

      at a set temperature.
  - bugfix: Plasma will no longer summon gas whenever transferring via syringe. AKA
      you can now do xenobio again.

  - rscdel: Removed random name enforcement when using "Always Random Species" as
      it discourages its use and manually chosen species don't have this naming restriction

      refresh your character anytime you change an attribute. Same for "Always Random
      Name" for your name and "Always Random Species" for your species.
  - rscadd: Can selectively spawn with random gender, age, backpack style, jumpsuit
      style (i.e. suit or skirt), maybe a couple of other shits I forgot that weren't
      previously affected by "Always Random Body"

      powder" (from "crayon powder"), to better reflect that it can't color anything

      isn't found in most crayons anymore.

  ATHATH:

      seek targets off bounces better, and can be purchased from cargo (for the .38)
      or nuke ops uplink (for the L6), but standard .38 ammo has a chance to ricochet
      as well.

      shrapnel, excellent for soft targets!
  - tweak: Shotguns and other multi-pellet guns now print aggregate messages, so you'll

      hit by the buckshot pellet in the X!" messages. Bye bye lag!
  - balance: Armor can now protect against embedding weapons, taking the best of either
      the bullet or bomb armor for the limb in question away from the embed chance.
      Some weapons are better at piercing armor than others!
  - rscadd: Due to pressure from various organizations, Nanotrasen is implementing
      a new ban on the purchase of alcohol and tobacco products for crewmembers under

      i initially put it at the start obj/fire_act proc but it caused hot ice to runtime
      when burned. This change will affect everything that uses fire_act and fire_react
      procs)
  - rscdel: Removed hot ice ability to make furnitures (to do this i had to add a
      new flag to all the base mats that had the MAT_CATEGORY_RIGID flag, the new
      flag is MAT_CATEGORY_BASE_RECIPES, if this flag is true then the four basic
      recipes will appear, otherwhise it wont)

  - tweak: Licking wounds on other people will automatically contract any diseases
      they're carrying. This is a one way transmission vector, you cannot contract
      disease from a felinid doctor in this way due to the partially antiseptic nature
      of cat saliva or whatever
  - tweak: You also cannot lick wounds if your mouth is covered or if you do not,
      in fact, possess a tongue
  - bugfix: Your clothes and items will no longer be covered in distressingly human
      looking blood when bashing borgs to bits

  - rscadd: Skeletons and plasmamen can now suffer bone wounds!
  - tweak: Dismemberment is now integrated with wounds! Simply apply a critical bleeding

      liver, or stomach (and they need them to survive)
  - tweak: Formaldehyde replaces calomel in paramedic belts

  - tweak: Wounds that have their removal requirements met while the patient is on
      a stasis bed will now be cured of their wounds as expected. In addition, burn
      wounds will slowly recover while stasis'd if they have flesh regen/sanitizer
      applied
  - bugfix: Examining a bleeding dead body now reflects that dead bodies don't actually
      bleed, saying their blood is pooling instead
  - tweak: Coagulant is now slightly less effective per bleeding wound for each bleed
      wound on a patient

      and changes to rework the spell for being a melee spell.

      while using .357 bullets.

  - admin: Midround/latejoin dynamic timers are now configurable.

      them up.
  Thalpy:
  - rscadd: Adds a new reaction mechanic that allows reaction to occur in an incremental
      fashion. This uses temperature to determine reaction rate and pH to determine
      purity. The hotter it is, the faster it reacts. Keeping your pH within the range
      (default 5-9) will keep it pure, with the further out you are affecting your
      purity. Reactions are also H+ consuming/producing and exo/endothermic.
  - rscadd: Adds purity mechanics for reactions - if a purity extremely low at the
      end of a reaction then it will convert into viscous sludge or a failed chem.
      When a reagent is consumed; If a reagent is very impure it will inverse into
      another chem. This inversion will remove all of the original chem and take its
      place instead. If it's slightly impure then it will split into an impure chem
      with respect to purity. The ratio of original to impure is determined by the
      purity of the original when consumed.
  - rscadd: 'Adds the following basic impure reagents to accommodate the changes above:
      Chemical isomers, Toxic sludge and Viscous sludge.'
  - rscadd: Acidic and basic buffers. These will self-consume when added to a reagent
      holder will other reagents in it, and alter the pH towards their respective
      extreme. Thereby altering the pH without affecting the volume. adds; Optional
      catalysts - these reagents will speed up the reaction of a certain type. Presently
      Palladium synthate catalyst exists and works on medicine reagents only.
  - rscadd: Competitive reactions - Tempomyocin and Purity tester are reactions that
      compete based off temperature. Tempomyocin is a reagent that will instantly
      speed up a reaction based off its purity and the purity tester reagent will
      fizzle if the solution it is added to has anything impure in it.
  - rscadd: Adds an overheat/impure mechanic during reactions - overheating your reaction
      past it's overheat point will reduce the yield of your product by 2% per tick,
      with some reactions having special explosions instead. If overly impure it will
      reduce the purity of all reagents present in the beaker.
  - rscadd: 1 dropper and 1 bottle of acidic buffer (you can make this) to the chemist's
      locker. Gives chemists a starting dropper and random buffer. Added pH booklets
      to the chemists chemdrobe - these can tell you the pH of a beaker by ripping
      a sheet out of them and using it on a beaker or reagent holder
  - rscadd: Adds a pH meter than can be researched and printed from the med lathe.
      When used on a reagent holder it will tell you a detailed breakdown of the reagents
      in the beaker, including pH, volume and purity. It will also detect ongoing
      reactions.
  - rscadd: Adds pH to all reagents - the pH of a beaker/holder will be the sum of
      all reagents with respect to volume. pH is an abstracted potential of hydrogen
      that affects reactions.
  - tweak: "heavily edited the chem heater into a reaction chamber, showing multiple\
      \ details on a reaction, edited chem master and chem dispenser\u2019s UI to\
      \ show pH."
  - tweak: "You can now use droppers and syringes directly on heaters to affect the\
      \ beaker inside of it (provided there\u2019s a beaker in there)"
  - tweak: Tweaks most reagents to use a default handler. The ones omitted are ones
      that rely on being instant. This default has a minimum reaction temperature
      of 100, an optimal temperature of 500 and an overheat temperature of 900+. Their
      optimal pH range is 5-9; which will result in a purity 1 reagent when kept within
      this window. If the reaction is within a pH window of 1-4 or 9-13 the resulting
      purity will be dependent on the deviation from 5 or 9. <1 or >14 will create
      impure chems for every step. If your final purity on the end of a reaction is
      less than 0.15, then it will collapse into Viscous sludge. The reaction is mildly
      exothermic and H+ consuming.
  - tweak: tweaks chocolate milk, firefighting foam and hercuri reactions to work
      better with the new mechanics. These inherit the same pH windows as above but
      are cold reactions instead.
  - soundadd: added several sound effects for chemistry
  - imageadd: added melting beaker icons, pHbooklets and pHmeters

  Ryll/Shaps:
  - rscadd: You can now smack your hand on tables to emphasize a point! Simply ready
      a slapper with *slap, then click on an empty table! Doing so with a left-click
      lets you fire off a series of weaker slaps, while a right-click makes one big,
      loud slam for maximum impact!
  - bugfix: Right clicking someone in combat mode as a hulk will now shove them, like
      it does for normal humans
  SparkezelPL:

      nice to know you singulo...
  Thalpy:
  - bugfix: Fixes the randomly failing unit test that sometimes happens.
  Timberpoes:
  - balance: ID cards have now completely changed. ID cards have limited available
      access slots increased by card rarity and the specific job trim. Jobs with more
      innate access now have more valuable ID cards. Better watch your backs!
  - balance: Yes, this means that you can no longer mass-distribute unrestricted All
      Access. During War Ops, you're expected to protect the diskie and disk holder.
      Sec can distribute guns. Cargo can order guns. You can still get key accesses
      like Maint on any ID card. HoP can still create and trim special silver ID cards
      for high value staff members to get more access. Adapt. Overcome. Suffer.
  - balance: 'Chameleon ID cards are completely reworked. Instead of copying all accesses
      from a card, they now open up an interface where you can select up to 5 accesses
      to copy over depending on the target card''s access. tweak: The ID Console has
      been updated to reflect these new changes including a somewhat improved layout.
      You can apply job templates direct to cards via a drop-down interface and these
      templates will attempt to fill out as many accesses on the card as it can based
      on the card''s trim and the template''s wildcard setup. tweak: The PDA Painter
      has now been upgraded with a tgui interface. It can be used to paint PDAs the
      same as before, but can now also change the trim on ID cards. This procedure
      will remove all access levels from the ID card in the process, leaving you with
      a freshly trimmed blank ID card. tweak: Captain job trims now have a white star
      instead of a dull grey star. removed: Mining Conscript Card has been removed
      and replaced with a spare mining ID that holds and has the access the Conscript
      card gave. tweak: The Captain''s Spare ID has been moved from the Captain''s
      locker to a secure safe on the bridge. The highest ranking Command member on
      shift start is given the codes to this safe, generally following the chain of
      command. The QM is part of this and can, in exceptional circumstances where
      no other heads join the shift, become Acting Captain. Their ID card would be
      given Bridge access if they were picked as Acting Captain to allow them to access
      the captain''s spare. If nobody in the chain of command joins the shift, the
      next latejoined player from the chain of command will be given the codes for
      the spare and promoted to Acting Captain automatically. tweak: The secure safe
      on the bridge is a special variant that is immune to conventional weaponry and
      lacks the hacking mechanic of ordinary wall safes. Maybe if you could examine
      it close enough, you''d find hints to its weaknesses... tweak: Examining players
      now shows a more detailed representation of any ID card in their ID slot.'
  - rscadd: Added the world's worst coder sprites for ID card overlays including PDA,
      Laptop and Wallet icons for when they're in the ID Card slot too. May God have
      mercy on your souls, for my spriting skills have none.
  necromanceranne:
  - rscadd: Adds basic cybernetic eyes to the medical protolathe and mechfab. Adds
      improved cybereyes (equal to human eyes) to the Cybernetic Organs tech node.

  - bugfix: A recent firmware update reenabled the screens on Nanotransen brand computers.
  - bugfix: Bloodsplatter no longer experiences phantom limb syndrome on people missing
      both of their arms.
  - bugfix: Recent budget cuts have resulted in accessories no longer having magnets
      strong enough to pull bloodstains directly out of clothing. Washing machine
      usage has jumped 50% over the last week.
  - bugfix: No one is entirely certain who injected the the design schema for neon
      error signs into the mind magnification helmet production line, but the affected
      units have been recalled and the perpetrator <i>will</i> be brought to justice.
  Timberpoes:
  - qol: Plexus Access Management app has had the Basic tab renamed to Trim to indicate
      that these accesses are available because of the card's trim. It also has an
      access counter so players can see they're able to change it.
  - qol: Plexus Access Management app has had the logic for displaying the used/available
      accesses for any given wildcard inverted. It now shows Used/Max instead of Available/Max.
  - bugfix: Wallets no longer show redundant examine text.
  Time-Green:
  - rscadd: Plumbing reaction chambers now have connects for acidic (yellow) and basic
      (green) buffers! You can set the UI to indicate at what pH the reaction chamber
      is supposed to insert a buffer into the reaction.
  - rscadd: Adds plumbing bufferers. Place a bunch of them next to each other, set
      a threshold amount with right click and screwdriver them. Once all are above
      the threshold, only then will they start providing chems. Great for waiting
      steps and carefully dosing amounts!
  - balance: The reaction chamber no longer pulls specific chems, and instead has
      a set volume it works towards before being able to react.
  carshalash:
  - balance: Oxidates blue cherries and makes parsnips cause Alzheimer's
  mozi_h:
  - rscadd: Folders have a snazzy new look. (Check out those colours!)

  Timberpoes:
  - bugfix: The Plexagon Access Management app has been upgraded and allows Heads
      of Staff to demote any ID card that has a trim they'd ordinarily be able to
      apply as a template. This means the HoS can now demote departmental sec officers
      like Security Officer (Science).
  YakumoChen:
  - rscadd: A less-than-new Syndicate Special bundle reminds you of the good old days
      when we didn't need all those newfangled traitor items the young-uns get. We
      had 6 items in the uplink and we had Monkey in rotation and by god we made do.
  tralezab:

      are still the best way to get stuff, though.
  - spellcheck: fixed typo on the engineering voidsuit
  - rscadd: Minebots treads now make noise as they move!
2021-03-05:
  ATHATH:
  - refactor: The definition of the transfer_blood variable (of gloves) has been moved
      from the file that otherwise only contains the code of damp rags to the file
      that defines the other variables of gloves, and has also been documented.
  - balance: Radioactive microlasers can no longer knock out creatures who are immune
      to the effects of radiation.
  - bugfix: The radioactive microlaser now calculates the strength of its delay effect
      using the intensity setting it had when you initially used it on your victim,
      not the intensity setting it currently has. This prevents people from "cheating
      out" its intensity 20 effect with only a 2 second delay and a 1 second cooldown.
  - balance: Radioactive microlasers no longer contain twice as much metal as normal
      health analyzers do.

  EdgeLordExe:
  - rscadd: Adds a new system for handling organ failure, the old system is still
      there for organs that havent been ported yet.
  - rscadd: Liver is now using the new system for organ failure, which means that
      once it reaches 100 damage (liver is dead) it will give you a 1 minute warning
      period for you to get to medbay, after that 1 minute the effects of liver failure
      will slowly ramp up to comparably old levels of deadliness.
  Foxtrot (Funce):

      connected to the Brig Checkpoint flasher button.
  Thalpy:
  - qol: Tweaks cryostylane to use the new reaction mechanics, incorporating stasis
      iceblocks, freezing, temporary organ decay prevention and surgery slows. Cryostylane
      when added to a corpse will tint them blue and pause organ decay temporarily,
      while it is in a mob it will slow down all surgery applied upon them. Inverse
      cryostylane will freeze you in a block of ice and put you in stasis (living
      and dead).
  - qol: Tweaks cyrostylane to have a more indepth reaction, where colder temperatures
      will cause it's purity to decrease.
  - code_imp: cleans up some of holder.dm code and adds a REAGENT_IGNORE_STASIS bitflag.
  Timberpoes:
  - bugfix: All uplink kits that previously had agent ID cards that were lost to the

      not notice any new roundstart ID access changes by the time they're reading
      this changelog entry and will hopefully start with maximum job access at any
      population level because it is intended, rather than because of a bug.

      can multitool the sender and then the vendor to do the connection), the vendors
      are wall mounted tank dispensers where you can decide you gas mix based on the
      input in the UI. The gases are not free tho (unless the atmos man that is managing
      the sender just set them free), you will have to pay a sum based on the gas
      price times the gas amounts, the sum will be taken from your card and sent to
      the engi department.
