      along with the secondary meth recipe. The original recipe still works.
  - experiment: Foam now produces more bang for your buck when mixed. Your foam grenades
      should be larger now to account for the slowdown.
  - rscadd: Adds Stabilizing Agent. This chemical will prevent the effects of certain
      reactions from taking place in  the container it is in, such as Smoke Powder
      and Flash Powder, allowing you to get the raw forms of the powders for heating
      up later.
  - rscadd: Smoke Powder and Flash Powder can now be mixed along with Stabilizing
      Agent in order to produce a powder version of the effects. You can then heat
      these powders to 374K to get the effects.
  - rscadd: Mixing them without Stabilizing Agent gives the default effects.
  - rscadd: Adds Sonic Powder, a chemical that deafens and stuns within 5 tiles of

      caused by it scales based on your fire stacks.

      if it has oxygen to react with. Useful for when you want a delayed mix inside
      of someone.
  - rscadd: Adds Cryostylane.  This reagent does the opposite of Pyrosium, but it
      still requires oxygen to react with.
  - rscadd: Adds Phlogiston. This reagent ignites you and gives you a single fire
      stack every 3 seconds. Burn damage from this chemical scales up with the fire
      stacks you have. Counter this with literally any chemical that purges other
      chems.
  - experiment: Smoke now transfers reagents to the mob, and applies touch reactions
      on them. This means smoke can run out of reagents, no more infinite acid smoke.
      It also only works on mobs, use the new Reagent Foam(tm) for your hellfoam needs.
      I suggest a CLF3 Fluoroacid Black Powder mix.
  - experiment: Added a derelict medibot to the code, will place a few on the derelict
      when this PR is merged as to prevent mapping conflicts.
  - rscadd: Adds Initropidril. 33% chance to hit with 5-25 TOX damage every 3 seconds,

  - rscadd: Adds Pancuronium. Paralyses you after 30 seconds, with a 7% chance to
      cause 3-5 loss of breath. Get it from the traitor Poison Kit.

      your stamina. Get it from the traitor Poison Kit.
  - rscadd: Adds Sulfonal. +1 TOX per 3 seconds, knocks you out in 66 seconds. Mix
      it with Acetone, Diethylamine, and Sulfur.
  - rscadd: Adds Amantin. On the last second it is in you, it hits you with a stack
      of TOX damage based on how long it's been in you. Get it from the traitor Poison
      Kit.
  - rscadd: Adds Lipolicide. +1 TOX unless you have nutriment in you. Mix it with
      Mercury, Diethylamine, and Ephedrine.
  - rscadd: Adds Coiine. +2 TOX and +5 loss of breath every 3 seconds. Get it from
      the traitor Poison Kit.
  - rscadd: Adds Curare. +1 TOX, +1 OXY, paralyzes after 33 seconds. Get it from the
      traitor Poison Kit.
  - rscadd: Adds a reagent_deleted() proc to reagents for effects upon the last time
      it processes in you, like with Amantin.
  - bugfix: Neurotoxin required temperature for mixing has been set to 674K, it was
      370K for some reason.
  xxalpha:
  - rscadd: 'Added Cybernetic Implants: Security HUD, Medical HUD, X-Ray, Thermals,

      I am?
  Incoming5643:
  - bugfix: Summon Events has been reworked to be a bit less manic.
  - rscadd: Summon Events will turn off if the wizard and all apprentices die. Any
      lingering effects are not reversed however.
  - rscadd: Improving Summon Events will reduce the average time between events, but
      not the minimum time between events.
  - rscdel: Departmental Uprising has been made admin only for being an RP heavy event
      that creates antags in an enviroment that doesn't really support that.

      synced to your assigned station's camera network. In addition, the helmets also
      include mounting points for the Seclite model of flashlights, found in your
      station's security vendors.
  - rscadd: Nanotrasen Security helmets are designed for easy repairs in the field.
      Officers may remove their Seclite attachment with any screwdriver, and the camera's
      assembly may be pried off with a crowbar. The assembly is also compatible with
      analyzer upgrades for scanning through the station's structure, and EMP shielding
      is possible by applying a sheet of plasma.
