  /tg/station ss13 team:
  - unknown: You need an agressive grip to table now, as well as being within one
      tile of the table (to nerf teletabling).
  - unknown: Teleport only runs once at the beginning of the round, hopefully reducing
      the lag in wizard rounds.
  - unknown: Wizards can't telepot back to their shuttle to afk now.
  - unknown: Someone added it a while ago and forgot to update the changelog - syndies
      in nuke need to move their shuttle to the station's zlevel first.
  - unknown: Bunch of other stuff.
