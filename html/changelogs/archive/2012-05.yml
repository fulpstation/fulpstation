  - imageadd: -Added fat jumpsuit sprites for orange, pink, yellow, owl, security,
      and warden jumpsuits.
  - tweak: -Somatoray is hopefully more useful and less buggy when used on trays.
      -Botanists now have morgue access, because of their ability to clone via replica
      pods. Try not to get this removed like all your other access, okay hippies?

      recipes for the removed drinks. Get cracking, bartenders. -You now need 10 sheets
      of metal instead of 2 to make a gas canister, people can't FILL ENTIRE ROOMS
      WITH THEM.
  - rscadd: "-Emergency Toolboxes now contain smaller, lighter fire extinguishers\
      \ that actually fit inside them!\n\t"

  Sieve:
  - rscdel: 'Reverted dismemberment, the recent gun changes, and Tarajans. Before
      you shit up the forums, read this:'
  - unknown: Dismemberment was ported from Bay12, but only halfway, and there were
      several problems with it. I know many people really liked it, but as it stood
      it did not fit the playstyle here at all. This <b>had</b> to be removed, there
      is work on a more fitting system, but this had to be taken out first regardless,
      and the longer people beat around the bush the worse the situation got.
  - unknown: The gun change was made for no real reason and was pretty problematic,
      so reverting that should mean there are a lot less 'accidental suicides.'
  - unknown: Tarjans were reverted by request as well, and since keeping them working
      after removing dismemberment would be a stupid amount of work.
2012-05-11:
  Important changes below!:
  - tweak: Authors note, there was nothing below save for the previous day!!
2012-05-14:
  Nodrak:

      for it.

  - rscadd: <font color="red">The new user interface is here. If anything is broken
      or something should be done differently please post feedback on the forum. <b>Spriters
      are encouraged to make new sprites for the UI.</b></font>
  - rscadd: When you receive a PDA message, the content is displayed to you if the
      PDA is located somewhere on your person (so not in your backpack). You will
      also get a reply button there. This will hopefully make PDA communication easier.
  - rscadd: <b>New hotkeys!</b> delete is the now the 'stop dragging' hotkey, insert
      is the 'cycle intents' hotkey.
2012-05-22:
  Icarus:
  - rscadd: RIG helmets can now be used as flashlights, just like hardhats. Credit
      to Sly for the sprites.

      Room can now be accessed from the main hall.
2012-05-23:
  Errorage:
  - tweak: Some of the more pressing issues with the new user interface were addressed.
      These include the health indicator being too far up, the open inventory taking
      a lot of space, hotkey buttons not being removable and suit storage not being
      accessible enough.
  - rscadd: A toggle-hotkey-buttons verb was added to the OOC tab, which hides the
      pull, drop and throw buttons for people who prefer to use hotkeys and never
      use the buttons.
  - rscadd: Added a character setup option which allows you to pick between the Midnight,
      Orange and Old iconsets for the user interface.
2012-05-26:

      give you latin charisma. They replace the boxing gloves in the fitness room.
      Boxing gloves are still available in the holodeck. -Fake moustache tweaked and
      given new sprites.
  Donkie:
  - rscadd: You can now dispense Disposal Bins, Outlets and Chutes from the disposal
      dispenser. These are movable and you can attach them above open trunks with
      a wrench, then weld them to attach them completely. You can remove Bins by turning
      off their pump, then screwdriver, then weld, then wrench. Same with outlet and
      chute except for the pump part.
