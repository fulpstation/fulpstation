  Aranclanos:
  - bugfix: <strike>A buncha crud nobody cares about lol</strike> Added a light to
      the airlock wiring interface to show the status of the timing.
  - bugfix: You can't fill sprays without being next to the dispenser.
  - bugfix: Simple animals no longer freeze to death in places with normal temperature.
  - bugfix: Mechs no longer freeze on the spot when they are using the Energy Relay
      on powerless areas.
  - bugfix: Improvements to showers, they now clean gear on beltslot, back, ears and
      eyes. Showers only clean visible gear.
  - bugfix: Replica pods works again! But you can't make potato people without a key
      or clone people who ghosted alive (Catatonic).
  - bugfix: Engiborgs can deconstruct airlocks with their RCDs once again.
  - bugfix: You can construct airlocks while standing on another airlock with RCDs.

  - imageadd: Facehuggers have a new animation, thanks to Sly.
  - rscadd: Firelocks, glass-less airlocks and walls will stop heat.
  - rscadd: Fires are now more deadly, especially the flames.

  Giacom:
  - rscadd: New changeling powers!
  - rscadd: Hive Channel/Hive Absorb. Allows you to share your DNA with other changelings,
      very expensive chemical wise to absorb (download), not so much to channel (upload)!
      You cannot achieve your objective by sharing DNA.
  - rscadd: Mimic Voice! You can form your voice of a name you enter. You won't look
      like them but when you talk, people will hear the name of who you selected.
      While you're mimicing, you can't regenerate chemicals.
  - rscadd: Extract DNA! A power that allows you to silently sting someone and take
      their DNA! Meaning you do not have to absorb someone to become them. Extracting
      their DNA doesn't count towards completing your objectives.
  - rscadd: You can now get flares from red emergency toolboxes. Has a 50% chance
      of a flash-light or a flare spawning.
  - imageadd: Flare icon by Ausops!
  - rscadd: Thanks to RavingManiac (Smoke Carter), Roros now lay eggs which can grow
      into baby roros or be used for cooking recipes. Scientists will need to expose
      the egg to plasma for it to hatch; while it is orange (grown).
  - imageadd: A new icon for the map spawned x-ray cameras. Icon by Krutchen.

  Giacom:
  - tweak: As an AI, you can type in the "track with camera" command and get a list
      of names to show up there. This also works with "list camera" verb. Remember
      to use space to auto-fill.
  - rscadd: Welding goggles have been added. They are like welding helmets but they
      are for the glasses equipment slot. Science and the assembly line are given
      a pair.
  - imageadd: Thanks to WJohnston for the welding goggle icons.
  - tweak: Small change to the Assembly Line. Instead of six normal flashes, the Assembly
      Line will instead have two normal flashes and eight synthetic flashes. Synthetic
      flashes only work once but are designed to be used in construction of Cyborgs.
  - tweak: Nar-Sie put on a few pounds. Thanks HornyGranny.

  Giacom:
  - rscadd: Throwing eggs will result in the reagents of the egg reacting to the target.
      (Which can be a turf, object or mob) This creates possibilities like chloral
      eggs, lube eggs, and many more.
  - rscadd: Aliens can now acid walls and floors! Not R-Walls though.
  - tweak: Facehugger throw range reduced to 5, so aim at humans that are 2 tiles
      apart from the edge of your screen.
  - tweak: Making eggs is a little more expensive but secreting resin is cheaper.
      (Both cost 75 now)
  - tweak: Aliens no longer have a random duration of stunning humans, it's a constant
      value now of the lower based value.
  - tweak: Acid is less random and will be more reliable. Don't bother aciding stuff
      more than once, as it will waste plasma.
  - rscadd: You can now target non-dense items (such as facehuggers) with a gun.
  - rscadd: You can now shoot canisters, computers and windoors to break them.

  - rscadd: 'Advance evolving diseases! Virology can now create, mutate and mix advance
      diseases together. I replaced the two bottles of blood in Virology with the
      advance disease. I''ll write a wiki article soon enough. Here''s a tip: Putting
      mutagen or virus food (a mixture of milk, water and oxygen) in blood with an
      existing disease will mutate it to gain symptoms. It can potentially lose old
      symptoms in the process, so keep backups!'
