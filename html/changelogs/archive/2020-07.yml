  - tweak: Licking wounds on other people will automatically contract any diseases
      they're carrying. This is a one way transmission vector, you cannot contract
      disease from a felinid doctor in this way due to the partially antiseptic nature
      of cat saliva or whatever
  - tweak: You also cannot lick wounds if your mouth is covered or if you do not,
      in fact, possess a tongue
  - bugfix: Your clothes and items will no longer be covered in distressingly human
      looking blood when bashing borgs to bits

  - rscadd: Skeletons and plasmamen can now suffer bone wounds!
  - tweak: Dismemberment is now integrated with wounds! Simply apply a critical bleeding

      dismember with just a sword or axe.
  - tweak: A few projectile types, namely buckshot and shotgun slugs, have had their
      damage reduced slightly to account for their new wounding abilities. Buckshot
      may take three shots to crit now, but you can also blast peoples limbs off!

      liver, or stomach (and they need them to survive)
  - tweak: Formaldehyde replaces calomel in paramedic belts

  - tweak: Wounds that have their removal requirements met while the patient is on
      a stasis bed will now be cured of their wounds as expected. In addition, burn
      wounds will slowly recover while stasis'd if they have flesh regen/sanitizer
      applied
  - bugfix: Examining a bleeding dead body now reflects that dead bodies don't actually
      bleed, saying their blood is pooling instead
  - tweak: Coagulant is now slightly less effective per bleeding wound for each bleed
      wound on a patient
