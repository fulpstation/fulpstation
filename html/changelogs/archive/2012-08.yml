  Giacom:
  - tweak: I've made some adjustments to the Fireball spell. I've changed it to shoot
      in the player's facing direction instead of you having to pick a name from a
      list. It will explode upon contact of a person, if it hits an obstacle or if
      it shoots for too long. To make up for the fireball not being able to go diagonal
      I've shortened the cooldown to 10 seconds. It still can hurt you badly and knock
      you down if you shoot it at a wall. Lastly, it now lights up so it'll show up
      in dark rooms easily.
  Sieve:
  - rscadd: Borgs can now have an encryption key installed into their internal radios.
      Simply ID, open the panel, and use the key to insert it (Screwdriver to remove)
  - rscadd: Due to that as well, borgs have a 'Toggle Broadcast Mode' button for their
      radios, which changes the broadcast type between station-bounced (Non-reliant
      on TComms), and subspace (Required for department channels)
  - tweak: Also changed the binary chat for consistency, now for the prefix is ':b'
      for everyone, not just one for humans and one for borgs/AIs/pAIs
  - tweak: Based on feedback, Nuke Op pinpointers now automagically change between
      shuttle and disk mode when the nuke is armed or disarmed.

  Icarus:
  - rscadd: Borgs now have flashlights to allow them to see in lightless areas
  - tweak: 'Changes to Medbay: The sleeper and storage rooms have been swapped around.
      Hopefully this leads to more healing and less looting.'
2012-08-04:
  Icarus:
  - tweak: Changes to Med-Sci south and surrounding maintenance areas. Virology is
      more isolated and Science gets a new Misc. Research Lab.
  - tweak: Atmos techs get construction access now to do their little projects in.
  - tweak: Transformation Stings now work on living humans.
2012-08-06:
  Dingus:
  - tweak: Library has been redesigned. It's a whole lot more classy now.
  - tweak: Significant changes to Medbay. CMO's office is more centralized, genetics
      has a new exit into cryogenics, and a new break room has been installed
2012-08-11:
  Sieve:
  - bugfix: Turrets now properly fire at simple_animals.
  - tweak: Borgs, AIs, and brains/MMIs can be sacrificed by cultists.
  - tweak: Grenades now automatically set throw on again.
2012-08-14:
  Sieve:
  - rscadd: DNA modifiers can be used if there is no occupant, primarily to handle
      the buffer.
  - tweak: Ion Rifles are only effected by max severity EMPs, so AOE from its own
      shot won't effect it
  - tweak: Pepper Spray fits on Sec belts again
2012-08-16:
  Errorage:
  - tweak: Changes were made to how heating and cooling of humans works.
  - tweak: You must wear both a space suit and space helmet to be protected from space!
      Likewise you must wear a firesuit and a fire helmet to be protected from fire!
      Fire helmets are red and white hardhats, found in all fire closets.
  - tweak: Fire suits now only protect from heat and space suits only protect from
      cold, so make your choice count.

  Nodrak:
  - bugfix: In-hand sprites once again update correctly when equipping items.
2012-08-24:
  Sieve:
  - rscadd: Floorbots now actually pull up tiles when emagged
  - tweak: All helper bots (excluding MULEs) have an access panel and maint panel,
      access being for behavior and maint for internal work
  - tweak: To open the maint panel, the access panel needs to be unlocked, then you
      use a screwdriver. There you can emag/repair it to your heart's content. (Emagging
      the access panel will also unlock it permanently)
  - tweak: Helper bots are now repaired by using a welder when their maint panel is
      open
2012-08-26:
  trubble_bass:
  - tweak: Nerfed the Neurotoxin drink, it is now less effective than a stunbaton.
      But more effective than a Beepsky Smash.
  - tweak: Updated descriptions on various cocktails to be more accurate or more relevant
      to the drink itself.
2012-08-28:

  - rscadd: You can now toggle the bolt light of airlocks. An extra wire,  that controls
      the airlock's bolt light, has been added.
  - rscadd: Aliens can now tell who is and who isn't infected. They get a special
      facehugger icon that appears over mobs that have been impregnated.

  Nodrak:
  - bugfix: Mice now work with the admin player panel. Admins can now turn players
      into mice with the 'Animalize' button in the player panel!
  - bugfix: Space bear AI no longer runs when a player is controlling it. Admins can
      now turn players into space bears with the 'Animalize' button in the player
      panel!
  - bugfix: The holodeck beach program once again has a beach.
  - bugfix: The nuke op shuttle floor was pressure-washed a few days ago. We have
      since re-painted it with nanotrasen blood. Sorry for any confusion.

  Giacom:
  - rscadd: You can now create an EMP Pulse. Like an explosion, it is the mixing of
      two reagents that trigger this to happen. I will tell you the first required
      reagent. Uranium. Have fun!
  - tweak: I have made most chemicals need 3-5 or more chemicals in order to react
      to a turf. For instance, you need at least 5 units of thermite splashed on a
      wall for it to burn down."
  - tweak: The EMP kit, that you can buy through the uplink, has two more grenades
      in them now. Making the box full of EMP grenades!
  - tweak: Changed the EMP grenade's range to be much bigger.

  Agouri:
  - bugfix: Overhauled newscasters. No visual additions but the thing is much more
      robust and everything works as intended. Wanted issues are fixed. Admins, check
      out Access News Network under Fun.
