  Ergovisavi:
  - rscadd: Walking Mushrooms will now attack and eat each other! They're all a little
      unique from each other, no two shrooms are exactly alike, and a better quality
      harvest means stronger Walking Shrooms. Pit them against each other for your
      entertainment.
  - rscadd: Each mushroom will have a different colored cap to identify them. When
      mushrooms eat each other, they get stronger. The resulting mushroom will drop
      more slices when cut down to harvest, and will have better quality slices.
  - rscadd: Don't hurt them yourself, though, or you'll bruise them, and mushrooms
      won't get stronger from eating a bruised mushroom. If your mushroom faints,
      feed it a mushroom such as a plump helmet to get it back on its feet. It will
      slowly regenerate to full health eventually.

  Demas:
  - rscadd: Attack sounds for all melee weapons! No more silent attacks.
  - tweak: The volume of an object's attack sound is based on the weapon's force and/or
      weight class.
  - rscadd: Welders, lighters, matches, cigarettes, energy swords and energy axes
      have different attack sounds based on whether they're on or off.
  - rscadd: Weapons that do no damage play a tap sound. The exceptions are the bike
      horn, which still honks, and the banhammer, which plays adminhelp.ogg. Surely
      nothing can go wrong with that last one.
  - tweak: When you tap someone with an object, the message now uses "tapped" or "patted"
      instead of attacked. The horn still uses HONKED, and the banhammer still uses
      BANNED.
  - bugfix: You won't get the "armour has blocked an attack" message for harmless
      attacks anymore.
  - rscadd: Adds 5 force to the lighter when it's lit. Same as when you accidentally
      burn yourself lighting it.
  - rscadd: Removes boldness from item attack messages on non-human mobs. The attack
      is bolded for a player controlling a non-human mob. Now your eyes won't jump
      to the chat when it's Pun Pun who's being brutalised.
  - bugfix: Blood will no longer come out of non-human mobs if the attack is harmless.
  - tweak: Adds a period at the end of the catatonic human examine message. That's
      been bugging me for years.
  - tweak: The activation and deactivation sounds of toy swords, energy swords and
      energy shields are slightly quieter. Energy swords and shields are now slightly
      louder than toys.
  - bugfix: You can no longer light things with burnt matches.
  - tweak: Match, cigarette and lighter attack verbs, forces and damage types change
      based on whether the object is lit or not.
  - bugfix: Fixes a bug with the energy blade that kept it at weight class 5 after
      it was deactivated. Who cares, it disappears upon deactivation.
  - tweak: Changes the welder out of fuel message slightly to be less fragmented.
  - tweak: Removes dead air from a lot of weapon sound effects to make them more responsive.
      In other words, the fire extinguisher attack sound will play a lot sooner after
      you attack than before.
  - tweak: Equalised the peak volumes of most weapon sounds to be -0.1dB in an attempt
      to make volumes based on force more consistent across different sounds.
2014-02-03:
  Demas:
  - tweak: Changes windoor and newscaster attack messages to be consistent with windows
      and grilles. This removes the distracting boldness from windoor attack messages,
      which is reserved for userdanger, and names the attacker.
  - rscadd: Thrown items now play a sound effect on impact. The volume of the sound
      is based on the item's throwforce and/or weight class.
  - tweak: The fireaxe now has 15 throwforce, when previously it had only 1. But why
      would you throw it away, anyway?
  - rscadd: Projectiles now play a sound upon impact. The volume of the sound depends
      on the damage done by the projectile. Damageless projectiles such as electrodes
      have static volumes. Practise laser and laser tag beams have no impact sound.
  - soundadd: Added sear.ogg for the impacts of damaging beams such as lasers. It
      may be replaced if player feedback proves negative.

  Yota:
  - tweak: Handling a couple flashlights will no longer transform you into the sun.  Each
      light source will have deminishing returns.
  - bugfix: Inserting lights into containers should no longer dim other lights.

  Razharas:
  - rscadd: Adds more constructible and deconstructable machines!
  - rscadd: Added constructible miniature chemical dispensers, upgradable
  - rscadd: Sleepers are now constructible and upgradable, open and close like DNA
      scanners, and don't require a console
  - rscadd: Cryogenic tubes are now constructible and upgradable, open and close like
      DNA scanners, and you can set the cryogenic tube's pipe's direction by opening
      its panel and wrenching it to connect it to piping
  - rscadd: Telescience pads are now constructible and upgradable
  - rscadd: Telescience consoles are now constructible
  - rscadd: Telescience tweaked (you can save data on GPS units now)
  - rscadd: Teleporters are now constructible and upgradable, the console has a new
      interface and you can lock onto places saved to GPS units in telescience
  - tweak: Teleporters start unconnected. You need to manually reconnect the console,
      station and hub by opening the panel of the station and applying wire cutters
      to it.
  - rscadd: Biogenerators are now constructible and upgradable
  - rscadd: Atmospherics heaters and freezers are now constructible and upgradable
      and can be rotated with a wrench when their panel is open to connect them to
      pipes. Screw the board to switch between heater and freezer.
  - rscadd: Mech chargers are now constructible and upgradable
  - rscadd: Microwaves are now constructible and upgradable
  - rscadd: All kitchen machinery can now be wrenched free

      inside and activate it if it's cryo
  - rscadd: Constructible newscasters, their frames are made with autolathes
  - rscadd: Constructible pandemics
  - rscadd: Constructible power turbines and their computers
  - rscadd: Constructible power compressors

  - wip: This update will have unforeseen bugs, please report those you find at https://github.com/tgstation/-tg-station/issues/new
      if you want them fixed.
  - rscadd: As usual, machines are deconstructed by screwing open their panels and
      crowbarring them. While constructing machines, examining them will tell you
      what parts you're missing.

  adrix89:
  - tweak: Spray Bottles can no longer  wet up to three tiles with water.
  - tweak: Spray Bottles have a third higher release volume that wets a single tile.
  - tweak: Water slip times are reduced to the same stun times as soap.

  Yota:
  - tweak: Photograph now rendered crisp and clean, so that we may enjoy them in their
      0.009 megapixel goodness.
  - bugfix: Cameras should now capture more of what they should, and less of what
      they shouldn't.
