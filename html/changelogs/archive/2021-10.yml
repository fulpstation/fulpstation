      wastes for icebox, when the stations has the random spawn trait
  Mothblocks:
  - admin: You can now cancel incoming and outgoing cross comms console messages.
  - bugfix: The species list will now scroll properly when there are too many. This
      has meant nothing up until this point, but will when Halloween races are enabled
      again.
  - admin: Added a preference to disable your usual deadmin preferences when you are
      spawned in CentCom. This is on by default.

      scanning!'

  Mothblocks:
  - bugfix: Midround wizard is now selectable.
  Pickle-Coding:
  - bugfix: Reactions will now properly fully react when it has moles to consume.
      Instead of the reaction stopping when one of the gasses is lower than reaction
      rate, it will instead adjust the reaction rate so that it consumes all of the
      gas.
  Ryll/Shaps:
  - balance: Getting hit by the tram and landing on lattice or unplated flooring (on
      the upper z-level) will now cause you to smash through it and fall to the z-level
      below at the cost of taking some extra damage. Note that floors with plating
      will still hold steady, so you can still use flooring to make getting hit by
      the tram insanely lethal, it just takes a bit more effort.
  esainane:
  - bugfix: The Space Hotel ruin's Staff Room and Staff Store now use distinct areas,
      and no longer have APCs fighting each other for control.

  - code_imp: moved some ai law defines to the proper file
  Wayland-Smithy:
  - bugfix: Fixed many Tramstation department sign arrows pointing to upload and vault.
  esainane:
  - refactor: Completely restructure HFR main processes, fixing many unusual edge
      cases when the HFR was unpowered, out of fuel, interacted with other subsystems
      poorly, etc.
  - refactor: HFR equations with cryptic parameters have all been rewritten to use
      mathematically equivalent normalized equations derived from human-parseable
      parameters.
  - code_imp: The HFR now has fewer superfluous and misleading checks.
  - code_imp: HFR configuration is now much more heavily documented and generally
      readable.
  - code_imp: Many HFR defines and comments which are unused, misleading, and/or completely
      inapplicable to any public release of HFR code have been removed.
  - bugfix: The HFR now only interacts with the SSair subsystem via the side IO components.
  - bugfix: The HFR will no longer fail to cool if atmospherics is running slowly.
  - bugfix: The HFR's ambient sound loop will no longer fail to update to match the
      current fusion level under certain conditions.
  - bugfix: The HFR will no longer fail to update its UI under certain conditions.
  - bugfix: The HFR will no longer melt down at speeds largely determined by the wider
      atmospherics system.
  - bugfix: The HFR can no longer get stuck in states which heal without taking damage
      or vice versa.
  - bugfix: The HFR's healing/damage effects that depend on fusion power level now
      genuinely depend on fusion power level, rather than doing nothing but at any
      power level.
  - bugfix: The HFR no longer uses two distinct functions to fire nuclear particles,
      which effectively doubled the rate under some conditions.
  - bugfix: The HFR now treats Iron Content as having appropriate units - fractional
      rather than percentage points. Accumulating Iron Content will now makes it slightly
      harder to destabilize the reaction (turn it endothermic), beware.
  - bugfix: The HFR now respects delta_time in more places, again, again.
  - bugfix: The HFR now respects delta_time in another place, again, again, again.
  - code_imp: Some HFR calculations have been greatly simplified (no mechanical change).
  - bugfix: The HFR will no longer accumulate iron if there is no live reaction.
  - bugfix: The HFR will no longer passively evaporate moderator gases if there is
      no live reaction.
  - bugfix: 'The HFR, after cracking under pressure, will no longer merely leave a
      pretty decal on the affected part while becoming immune to all future cracking
      conditions, as long as nobody repaired the crack. The initial spill if highly
      pressurized is still the most dangerous, but the HFR will continue to slowly
      leak its contents even under low pressure while cracked. content: The HFR initially
      took damage at unsafe fusion levels with excess mass over 2500-1500 moles, depending
      on temperature. This was later changed to 2700-2589 moles, but in a way that
      looked like it was only meant make the thresholds a few hundred moles more tolerant.
      The range is now 2700-1800 moles.'
  - bugfix: HFR production rate is no longer multiplied by both the fuel consumption
      modifier and the gas production modifier. This means the top tier Hypernoblium/Anti-noblium
      recipe is now worth using, providing a production bonus of 3x rather than a
      penalty of x0.03. This recipe is still just as hard to operate safely.
  - bugfix: The Abandoned Zoo ruin no longer has duplicate copies of an APC, power
      cable, and rack on the same tile.
  tralezab:
  - bugfix: You can now hold people at gunpoint from range!

  - refactor: Refactored the circuit list datatype to support composite types (i.e.
      entity list, any list, number list), which are lists that can only contain values
      of the specified datatype. This also refactors anything that uses the list datatype
      to use composite lists.
  - qol: NTNet components now use composite lists to send and receive data
  - bugfix: Prevented people from infinitely making lists with the list literal component.
  tralezab:
  - bugfix: Fixes catwalks not working at all!

      power by releasing zaps that will hit tesla coils around it. Roundstart setups
      might not be enough for bigger stations and t4 machines later in the round,
      recommended to upgrade the powergen.
  Ghommie:
  - expansion: 'The Mr. Deempisi Portrait plaque has been replaced with a very special
      picture frame: A small picture of one out four random things (Mr. Deempisi included)
      that can have a photo affixed over it. The photo will persist between rounds
      on that specific station until removed of if the frame is destroyed. Each station
      gets one, all but one (Kilo is too damn cramped) located in the bar behind the
