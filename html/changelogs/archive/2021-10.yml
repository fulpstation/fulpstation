      wastes for icebox, when the stations has the random spawn trait
  Mothblocks:
  - admin: You can now cancel incoming and outgoing cross comms console messages.

      spawned in CentCom. This is on by default.

      scanning!'

      gas.
  Ryll/Shaps:
  - balance: Getting hit by the tram and landing on lattice or unplated flooring (on
      the upper z-level) will now cause you to smash through it and fall to the z-level
      below at the cost of taking some extra damage. Note that floors with plating
      will still hold steady, so you can still use flooring to make getting hit by
      the tram insanely lethal, it just takes a bit more effort.

  - bugfix: The Space Hotel ruin's Staff Room and Staff Store now use distinct areas,
      and no longer have APCs fighting each other for control.

  esainane:
  - refactor: Completely restructure HFR main processes, fixing many unusual edge
      cases when the HFR was unpowered, out of fuel, interacted with other subsystems
      poorly, etc.
  - refactor: HFR equations with cryptic parameters have all been rewritten to use
      mathematically equivalent normalized equations derived from human-parseable
      parameters.
  - code_imp: The HFR now has fewer superfluous and misleading checks.
  - code_imp: HFR configuration is now much more heavily documented and generally
      readable.
  - code_imp: Many HFR defines and comments which are unused, misleading, and/or completely
      inapplicable to any public release of HFR code have been removed.
  - bugfix: The HFR now only interacts with the SSair subsystem via the side IO components.
  - bugfix: The HFR will no longer fail to cool if atmospherics is running slowly.
  - bugfix: The HFR's ambient sound loop will no longer fail to update to match the
      current fusion level under certain conditions.
  - bugfix: The HFR will no longer fail to update its UI under certain conditions.
  - bugfix: The HFR will no longer melt down at speeds largely determined by the wider
      atmospherics system.
  - bugfix: The HFR can no longer get stuck in states which heal without taking damage
      or vice versa.
  - bugfix: The HFR's healing/damage effects that depend on fusion power level now
      genuinely depend on fusion power level, rather than doing nothing but at any
      power level.
  - bugfix: The HFR no longer uses two distinct functions to fire nuclear particles,
      which effectively doubled the rate under some conditions.
  - bugfix: The HFR now treats Iron Content as having appropriate units - fractional
      rather than percentage points. Accumulating Iron Content will now makes it slightly
      harder to destabilize the reaction (turn it endothermic), beware.

  - bugfix: The HFR now respects delta_time in another place, again, again, again.

  - bugfix: The HFR will no longer accumulate iron if there is no live reaction.
  - bugfix: The HFR will no longer passively evaporate moderator gases if there is
      no live reaction.
  - bugfix: 'The HFR, after cracking under pressure, will no longer merely leave a
      pretty decal on the affected part while becoming immune to all future cracking
      conditions, as long as nobody repaired the crack. The initial spill if highly
      pressurized is still the most dangerous, but the HFR will continue to slowly
      leak its contents even under low pressure while cracked. content: The HFR initially
      took damage at unsafe fusion levels with excess mass over 2500-1500 moles, depending
      on temperature. This was later changed to 2700-2589 moles, but in a way that
      looked like it was only meant make the thresholds a few hundred moles more tolerant.
      The range is now 2700-1800 moles.'
  - bugfix: HFR production rate is no longer multiplied by both the fuel consumption
      modifier and the gas production modifier. This means the top tier Hypernoblium/Anti-noblium
      recipe is now worth using, providing a production bonus of 3x rather than a
      penalty of x0.03. This recipe is still just as hard to operate safely.
  - bugfix: The Abandoned Zoo ruin no longer has duplicate copies of an APC, power
      cable, and rack on the same tile.

      to use composite lists.

  - expansion: 'The Mr. Deempisi Portrait plaque has been replaced with a very special
      picture frame: A small picture of one out four random things (Mr. Deempisi included)

  - bugfix: Organs will now consistently "Fail" once they have reached max damage
  YakumoChen:
  - spellcheck: Gives shaft miner a more accurate job description
  esainane:
  - refactor: Radiation Collectors, Tesla Coils, and Grounding Rods are now subtypes
      of a common energy_accumulator type. This centralizes logic for smoothing energy
      release; converting between Joules, Watts, and internal energy units; and ensures
      that all such accumulators display and generate power along the same smoothing
      curve.
  - bugfix: Tesla Coils no longer generate power using half the smoothing that Radiation
      Collectors used. This was due to a mistake in handling delta_time.
  - code_imp: Removed many magic numbers from power generation code.
  - qol: Tesla Coils will now display energy stored in Joules and power being produced
      in Watts, much like Radiation Collectors did.
  - qol: Grounding Rods will now display recent energy they've absorbed and the sustainable
      power that this energy could be producing. It should now be very obvious if
      you could use more Tesla Coils.
  - bugfix: Fixed supermatter lightning bolt target selection. Previously, two grounding
      rods were always* safe. Now, one grounding rod is always* safe.
  - qol: Roller Beds now come with an examine hint for how to roll them up.
  lovegreenstuff:
  - bugfix: probital now works properly on ingest. you now get mitogen again
  magatsuchi:
  - rscadd: added ability to change hologram appearance to custom character
  tralezab:

      methods of destruction." and only the splash screen can be interacted with
  - bugfix: you can no longer exploit the pink crossbreeding power to strip factions
      from mobs

      ninja intervention), similar to every other high risk item.
  esainane:
  - rscadd: When all else fails, dusting a Clown can alter the Supermatter's containment
      field. It might make the situation better. It might not. Who knows, HONK

  - spellcheck: fixed a single bracket typo
  tralezab:
  - bugfix: fixes an error in department officers spawning with wallets
2021-10-19:
  Cyberboss:
  - bugfix: Prying open one of a pair of cycle-linked airlocks will now always close
      the other (if it is powered).
  - expansion: 'Arrivals, escape, and pod airlocks now restrict those without access
      from exiting directly to space. Use is unrestricted when entering the station
      or a shuttle is docked. tweak: Shuttle departures will now force exterior airlocks
      closed on both the shuttle and docking bay. The lives of your fellow crew members
      are more important than your tardiness and limbs, employee!'
  - bugfix: Fixed the numbering of escape pods in certain maps.
  Ebin-Halcyon:
  - balance: Syndicate masks are now fire + acid proof

  MeyHaZah, Onule, Fikou:
  - imageadd: mining gear resprite
  Mothblocks:

      shuttles. The Gigafactral and the Monastery were moved over (and made cheaper),
      while the Disco Inferno and Oh, Hi Daniel make a return.
  Ryll/Shaps:
  - admin: As an admin, if you start replying to a freshly submitted ticket that another
      admin is already replying to, you'll get a notice that someone already has it
      open when you get the prompt. Nice to let you know someone else is handling
      it, so you can coordinate replies better!
  That REALLY Good Soda Flavor:
  - refactor: Rolling paper will now use the customizable reagent holder component.
      This cleans up the code and expands the possibilities for using the component
      by adding support for dried items.
  esainane:
  - bugfix: Removed a scrubbers pipe that didn't lead anywhere near Upper Hydroponics
      on Tram.
2021-10-20:

      can't interact with throgh shift-click.

  - bugfix: Fixed honorbound people being unable to pull, examinate and alt-click
      other living mobs while holding an item that could be used as a melee weapon.
  - bugfix: Fixed mechas firing their weapons or using their tools when the pilot
      is examinating things through shift-click.
  Mickyan:
  - expansion: Nearsighter quirk now lets you pick the look of your prescription glasses
      from the character preference menu
  - imageadd: Added thin prescription glasses
2021-10-21:
  ATHATH:
  - bugfix: Butter bears can now attack objects, as they were intended to.
  - bugfix: Fugu glanded butter bears can now break down walls, matching the behavior
      of other fugu glanded mobs.
  - bugfix: Butter bears can now deal damage with their attacks if their melee damage
      variables (which are zero by default) become nonzero.
  - bugfix: Butter bear attacks are now considered to be blunt instead of sharp for
      the purposes of wounds.
  Coconutwarrior97:
  - rscadd: Adds a hydroponics airlock type, and replaces old medical hydroponics
      doors with the newer airlock type.
  - bugfix: Fixes an issue where people with the doctor phobia were afraid of hydroponics
      doors.
  Ghommie:
  - balance: Moved Pun Pun away from the kitchen on Delta. It's now behind the bar
      counter.

  - imageadd: Botany tools have been resprited!
  Sealed101:
  - bugfix: The internal radio implant from Icebox departures has been returned to
      it's owner's internal organs. A normal handheld radio has been left in its place.
  - bugfix: The american sausage has become edible AND roast-stick-friendly!
  - bugfix: Fixes advanced roasting stick griddling itself when used on a bonfire
      with a rod griddle built over it instead of using the bonfire to roast the sausage.
  Timberpoes:
  - bugfix: Fixed an issue where the unbanning panel would give inaccurate information
      about the ban in the unban confirmation prompts.
  - bugfix: Fixed an issue where clicking the X to close out the confirmation popup
      on the unbanning panel acted as if you'd pressed Yes.
  - admin: Added a reban button to the unbanning panel. This allows an admin to quickly
      and easily re-apply a ban they've removed and replaces the unban button when
      a ban has been removed. As a result, accidentally removing the wrong ban no
      longer requires the admin to place a second brand new ban on top of the old
      one.
  - admin: Editing the IP, ckey or CID of a server ban will now kick any players matching
      the edited ban's new details.
  Zytolg:
  - bugfix: Tramstation is now free from oddly decaled walls.
  - bugfix: The Lavaland Syndicate Base is now Powered again.
  - code_imp: repathed /unpowered Syndicate Base areas to /powered
  esainane:
  - bugfix: Gas Filters will now always attempt to move gas, as long as at least one
      output has space available. Any gas not able to be moved to its destination
      is returned to the input as if it was never removed. Previously, only gases
      for the main output port would continue to move when the other output port was
      full.
  - bugfix: Gas Filters again no longer leaves empty entries for gases that were filtered
      in the main output.
  - bugfix: Gas Filters again no longer outright destroys gas when no filters (or
      a bad filter, somehow) are set. Instead, it will go through to the main output,
      as before, or if the main output is full, be returned back to the input, as
      if never removed.
2021-10-22:
  Ghommie:
  - bugfix: Fixed the contents of certain coded or mapped closets exceeding their
      storage capacity, like the HoS closet on Delta, which had redundant grey HoS
      jumpsuit, trenchcoat and beret, or the mixed wardrobe closet with its duplicate
      bandanas, jacket and green jumpsuits,
  - bugfix: fixed implant abilities not being properly removed when the implant is
      removed.

      resolve any weakrefs passed to them through their list ports.
  - admin: The signal handler circuit component has two new presets, item_pre_attack_secondary
      and item_afterattack_secondary.
  - bugfix: Backup human names are once again respected when forcibly humanizing what
      would otherwise be a non-human head of staff.
  - admin: Added a "suppress_message_admins" variable to SDQL spells, which prevents
      the spell's query from getting output to all admins' chat panels. The query
      will still be written to the game log.
  - bugfix: The SDQL spell parse error modal grows properly.
  esainane:
  - bugfix: The Orion Trail's instructions screen is usable again.
  tralezab:

      already does.

  - qol: Art supplies are now also available in the library vendor in case the art
      storage room is not present on station

  JohnFulpWillard:
  - qol: Bounty consoles will now talk to the user if they have to wait for a new
      bounty or is using an incorrect ID, rather than telepathically transmit messages.
  PositiveEntropy:
  - imageadd: Resprites the defibrillator!
  Sealed101:
  - bugfix: fixes bomb implants blowing you up anyway when closing the window instead
      of pressing the "No" option

      the confirmation popup is still up
  Watermelon914:
  - balance: Makes wizard a high impact ruleset.
  esainane:
  - bugfix: The SM air alarm on MetaStation and TramStation once again starts unlocked,
      and can also be locked and unlocked by Engineers instead of just Atmospherics
      Technicians. This matches the setup on Delta, IceBox, and Kilo.
  jlsnow301:
  - spellcheck: Offering items to other players now has punctuation
  tralezab:
  - rscadd: Added a rare skillchip to maint.
2021-10-26:

  Fikou:
  - rscdel: the captain can no longer unlock his display case on delta without breaking
      it
  MMMiracles:

      break room or basic starter food to give a growing crew what they need to stay
      healthy.

      added to the public halls of Tramstation.

      again

      head of staff, rather than any head of staff.

      the legacy color removal
  Watermelon914:
  - bugfix: BCIs no longer runtime when they're created at mapload.
  - admin: Players now see any notes they may have gotten whilst disconnected when
      they join the server for the next time
  Zytolg:
  - expansion: Sofas now include the Bench Type. These are buildable with 2 metal
      plates from the crafting menu.
  - expansion: Beds can now be rotated (flipped), and include the Double Bed Type.
      Miners can also make Double Pod Beds to really feel like an Alaskan King.
  - expansion: Bedsheets to match! Try to share those big blankets with a lizard if
      you see that they're shivering!
  - code_imp: 'Stuff that lets you interact with the benches and beds in-game, so
      that you too can enjoy being a king. sprites: Ports the Benches and Double Bed
      sprites from Skyrat sprites: Flipped Beds'
  esainane:
  - code_imp: LabeledList.Item now supports arbitrary nodes as labels. String labels
      still work as previously.
  - code_imp: RoundGauge now supports an alertBefore property, for when warnings need
      to happen below a threshold. This can combine sensibly to form ranges with alertAfter.
  - refactor: The HFR interface has been heavily rewritten and restructured, fixing
      many edge cases where data was empty, unset, or took extreme values. Major parts
      now have their own file. The structure of gas lists is now consistent. Static
      data is used for more values. Much presentation layer logic has been moved to
      tgui instead of dm. Some processing that should never have happened, in tgui
      or anywhere else, is now gone forever.
  - qol: The HFR UI now displays the recipe specific gases that each fuel will create
      in a large table inside an expandable area. This can be collapsed when not needed.
  - qol: The HFR UI now uses a minimum mass for the scale of its gas lists. This should
      provide a visual cue for when a gas mix is running out, or needs more fuel to
      start.
  - qol: The HFR UI now graphs its various gas mixtures on a unified logarithmic scale,
      and tells you how fast the temperatures are changing in real units after all
      effects.
  - qol: The HFR UI now displays reactor status through gauges, with scales set to
      indicate typical ranges involved, and warnings to indicate when something is
      going wrong.
  - qol: The HFR UI now directly displays reaction instability, reaction activity,
      and the cell charge of the local APC. Reaction activity is the amount of heat
      output relative to what is permitted by the heat output limiter. This is effectively
      making explicit the result of a calculation you would otherwise need to do anyway,
      and makes it easier to notice when a reaction has stalled. qol; The HFR UI will
      now helpfully inform you in discerning red text if you have no recipe set, or
      if any one of the gas mixtures is empty. This should be particularly helpful
      for noticing when you didn't add any coolant. Please involve coolant when operating
      a nuclear reactor.
  - qol: The HFR UI now always lists Plasma, BZ, and Proto-Nitrate in the moderator
      gas list, and provides tooltips explaining their usage and purpose.
  - qol: The HFR UI now has many other tooltips, from explaining the function and
      purpose of the various reactor controls, to the fringe effects of uncommon moderator
      gases.
  - code_imp: heat_output_bool is gone forever yes this deserves its own changelog
      entry
  - bugfix: The RD's office in IceBox once again contains an AI Core circuit.

      after they confirm wanting to say it after a warning.
  - bugfix: Deadchat is now effected by OOC word filters
  - bugfix: A reason for a word being filtered will now be displayed nomatter what
      case the word is in

  axietheaxolotl:
  - imageadd: recoloured the CC commander envirosuit
  esainane:
  - bugfix: You can no longer use the *collapse emote to cheat your way out of stamcrit.
  - bugfix: Directional firelocks are now transparent, consistent with full-tile firelocks.
      This avoids some very strange behavior where you could see through a directional
      firelock when you were on the same tile.
  - bugfix: Assemblies attached over a wire will now always pulse the wire on activation,
      even if the wire is cut. You can create voice or signal activated airlocks again!
  - bugfix: Objects which use custom materials and break above 0 integrity no longer
      spawn broken.
  - code_imp: Made a comment which warned against breaking this sort of thing more
      explicit.
  - bugfix: Bits of space near the station are no longer randomly powered by unconnected
      areas. Outlet Injectors used for sending gas to space have been replaced with
      Passive Vents.
  - bugfix: The waste air from Virology on Tramstation will now be removed. Previously,
      the turf that the outlet injector was on was unpowered.
  - bugfix: Reinforced walls will now properly re-smooth when nearby reinforced walls
      are created or destroyed.
2021-10-28:
  Cyberboss:

      been removed.

      of mining access.

  - bugfix: orion can now no longer give you multiple prizes
  - qol: personal lockers will now allow you to actually un/lock them without swiping
      ID
  Watermelon914:
  - balance: If you try using the staff of change, the staff of chaos or the staff
      of healing as a crewmember, then it'll backfire. The Staff of change wabbajacks
      the user, like the pool of change; this means you can't become a xenomorph or
      a syndicate borg. The Staff of chaos has a 5% chance of firing the bolt directly
      at the user using it. The Staff of healing now behaves like a medibeam gun to
      non-wizards trying to use it.
  carshalash:
  - bugfix: Squirt cider now requires salt. Tomato soup no longer becomes squirt cider
  esainane:
  - bugfix: A roundstart Mannitol pill should no longer cause overdose on its own.
  optimumtact:
  - rscadd: Bans are now more user friendly
2021-10-29:
  ATHATH:
  - balance: Heavily EMPing a jumpsuit or another piece of under clothing will now
      short out its suit sensors (as if they had shorted out from damage to the jumpsuit)
      instead of randomizing their setting. You can repair them with a cable coil
      as normal.
  - bugfix: The sensor list will now be updated when your jumpsuit is EMP'd to reflect
      any possible changes in suit sensor status.
  - bugfix: Under clothing will now respect the EMP_PROTECT_SELF flag.
  ArcaneMusic:
  - bugfix: Double Bedsheets now properly show the bedsheet sprites.

  Mickyan:
  - code_imp: Vending machines no longer require a unique panel overlay for each new
      type
  Mothblocks:
  - bugfix: Felinids can no longer be head of staff if human authority is required.
  - bugfix: The foreigner quirk on felinids now works as it does with all other nonhumans
      who have their own languages, rather than also giving Galactic Uncommon.
  Sealed101:
  - bugfix: fixed a runtime in physical experiments trying to unregister a signal
      from a non-existant atom
  Timberpoes:
  - qol: Ordnance, Ordnance Storage and Atmospherics have been dropped to common-level
      accesses, allowing them to be added to any ID card instead of just silver and
      specific job trimmed cards.
  Watermelon914:
  - qol: Allows you to link integrated circuits to component printers and, as a result,
      let you print components off remotely which are put directly into your circuit.
  esainane:
  - bugfix: Pressure Tanks will now refuse to accept materials without a specific
      material type during construction.
  - bugfix: Pressure Tanks will now drop the correct amount of materials during deconstruction.
  - bugfix: Pressure Tanks will now send you flying if you continue to slice open
      a sufficiently pressurized tank despite the warning, rather than doing nothing.
  - bugfix: Pressure Tanks will release their gas contents when destroyed, rather
      than voiding them.
  - refactor: Reworked `/turf/var/intact` into variables which don't conflate underfloor
      visibility, underfloor interactability, and overfloor presence. This fixes many
      bugs relating to turfs in general, especially catwalks and glass flooring.
  - bugfix: The SM now properly provides bonus power for operating in a low pressure
      environment. Make sure you can keep it cool enough, and remember, space or a
      vacuum won't work, but it will damage the SM!
  - code_imp: Calculations relating to the SM pressure bonus are now derived from
      human readable parameters.
  jlsnow301:
  - rscdel: Removed leftover HTML from spawner menu
  - refactor: Spawner menu is now easier to read
  - bugfix: The crafting menu now uses scrollable sections, fitting the window regardless

      I really liked this one honestly, it's got an aggressive amount of heart and
      soul
  Timberpoes feat. JohnFulpWillard:
  - config: Modified how ambiguous VALUE_MODE_FLAG keyed_list config entries are parsed
      and added additional config logging for when weirdness with keyed_list config
      entries happens in general. (Timberpoes)
  - config: /datum/config_entry/keyed_list/probability was unused and has been deleted.
      (Timberpoes)
  - bugfix: The Cloth Golem preferences profile now works (JohnFulpWillard)
  - qol: The species-changing magic mirror variants now list species names instead
      of internal code IDs. (JohnFulpWillard)
  - qol: Shadowperson species should now show as "Shadow" instead of "???" (JohnFulpWillard)
  esainane:
  - imageadd: Hot Ice icons are now consistent, and now have an stack icon showing
      two pieces for when there are between 17 and 33 pieces in the stack.
