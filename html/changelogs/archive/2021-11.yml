  Mothblocks:
  - balance: Radiation is now a status effect, where you are either irradiated or
      not. When irradiated, you will take constant toxin damage, and irregular burn
      damage. Radiation is removed once all toxin damage is healed. Standing under
      a shower will pause the harmful effects of radiation, making it easier to heal.
      Everything that is irradiated will glow green.
  - balance: A lot of radiation sources keep their radiating capabilities, though
      most of it was eyeballed. If anything was significantly nerfed/buffed, feel
      free to let me know.
  - rscdel: Removes contamination from radiation.
  - balance: Uranium structures will irradiate those around them, but will be delayed,
      giving you time to stay away.
  - rscdel: The radioactive microlaser no longer irradiates, but still has its knockdown,
      which was never related.
  - balance: Seiver now heals high toxin damage when cold, but only if the patient
      is irradiated.
  - balance: Screwdriver (the drink) and Potassium Iodide are similar. They will heal
      toxin damage when the target is irradiated.
  - balance: Screwdriver, Potassium Iodide, and Pentetic Acid will halt the damaging
      effects of radiation, just like showers. This means no tox damage or burns.
  - balance: The gravity generator, instead of giving radiation when on, will now
      have a high gravity field around it.
  - balance: Radiation protection has been kept to engineering hardsuits, rad suits,
      and H.E.C.K. suits. This can be expanded to others, those are just the ones
      I recognized.
  - balance: Genetics no longer uses radiation, but instead genetic damage. Genetic
      damage works very similarly--once it tops 100%, you will start to take toxin
      damage. Gorillas are now made through genetic damage instead of radiation.
  - rscdel: Removed the halogen counter PDA app.
  - rscdel: Removed the emag effect on geiger counters, though an emag functionality
      can be added back later.
  - rscdel: Removed the geiger counter from cyborgs, but mostly because it's not actually
      really that useful anymore? Everything glows green!
  - rscdel: Removed the advanced wirebrush, a weird consumer of radiation with an
      extremely niche purpose. The standard wirebrush still exists.
  - rscdel: Removed radiation scanning from meson goggles.
  - rscdel: Removed leftover radiation collectors on ruins.
  - rscdel: Removed radiation from the radioisotope thermoelectric generator, though
      it still produces power. Trivia points if you actually know what that is!
  - balance: The EMP'd advanced energy gun now deals burn damage instead of radiation
      damage.
  - balance: Technetium 99 and Unstable Mutagen now deal toxin damage instead of radiation
      damage.
  - balance: Polonium will now irradiate the mob its in, and deal toxin damage if
      they're already irradiated (or can't be).
  - balance: Breathing tritium will now irradiate you after a certain amount, as well
      as deal toxin damage.
