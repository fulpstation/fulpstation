      of time.
  'Pete & Erro Christmas update:':
  - unknown: Reinforced metal renamed to steel and steel floor tile renamed to metal
      floor tile to avoid confusion before it even happens.
  - unknown: It is no longer possible to make steel from metal or vice versa or from
      the autolathe. You can however make metal from the autolathe and still insert
      steel to increase the metal resource.
  - unknown: To make steel you can now use the mining smelting unit and smelt iron
      and plasma ore.
  - unknown: The RCD can no longer take down reinforced walls.

  Errorage:
  - unknown: Fixed the comms console locking up when you tried to change the alert
      level.
  - unknown: Added a keycard authentication device, which is used for high-security
      events. The idea behind it is the same as the two-key thing from submarine movies.
      You select the event you wish to trigger on one of the devices and then swipe
      your ID, if someone swipes their ID on one of the other devices within 2 seconds,
      the event is enacted. These devices are in each of the head's offices and all
      heads have the access level to confirm an event, it can also be added to cards
      at the HoP's ID computer. The only event that can currently be enacted is Red
      alert.

  Erro:
  - unknown: Escape pods have been added to test the concept.
  - unknown: Escaping alone in a pod does not count towards the escape alone objective,
      it counts towards the escape alive objective tho. Escape alone only requires
      you to escape alone on the emergency shuttle, it doesn't require you to ensure
      all pods are empty. Cult members that escape on the pods do not ocunt towards
      the cult escaping acolyte number objective. Escaping on a pod is a valid way
      to survive meteor.

      burger can kill you.'
  - unknown: 'Because refrigeration serves a purpose now, the kitchen cold room freezing
      unit

      is turned off by default. Chefs should remember to turn the freezer on at the
