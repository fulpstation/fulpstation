      has liquidated its mime personnel and hired new mimes who know more routines.

  zxaber:
  - balance: Mecha ballistics weapons now require ammo created from an Exosuit Fabricator
      or the Security Protolathe, though they will start with a full magazine and
      in most cases enough for one full reload. Reloading these weapons no longer
      chunks your power cell. Clown (and mime) mecha equipment have not changed.
  - balance: The SRM-8 Missile Launcher has been replaced with the BRM-6 Breaching
      Missile Launcher in techwebs (Nukie Mauler remains equipped with the SRM-8).
  - balance: Both Missile Launchers and the Clusterbang Launcher do not have an ammo
      cache, and cannot be reloaded by the pilot. Once the initial loaded ammo has
      been spent, you can use the appropriate ammo box to load the weapon directly.

      cargo hold into other mechs.
