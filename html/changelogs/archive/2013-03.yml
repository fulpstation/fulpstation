  - rscadd: Petethegoat says, "Added a new feature involvi-GLORF"
  - tweak: Overhauled how grabs work. There aren't any interesting mechanical differences
      yet, but they should be a lot more effective already. You don't have to double
      click them anymore. Report any bugs with grabbing directly to me, or on the
      issue tracker.

  Carnie:
  - tweak: Empty character slots in your preferences screen will now randomize. So
      they won't initialise as bald, diaper-clad, white-guys.
  - tweak: Reworked the savefile versioning/updating code. Your preferences data is
      less likely to be lost.
