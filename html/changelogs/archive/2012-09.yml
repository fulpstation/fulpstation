  - rscadd: 'Cameras has changed quite a bit. They are no longer created from grenade
      canisters, instead you make them from an autolathe. The construction and deconstruction
      for them has also changed, so look it up or experiment it with yourself to see
      how to setup the cameras now. Cameras also get wires, like airlocks and APCs.
      There''s two duds, a focus wire, a power wire, an alarm wire and a light wire.
      Protip: You can see which one is the alarm wire by pulsing it.'
  - imageadd: Added a red phone and placed it in the Cyborg Station. Sprite by Pewtershmitz!
      You'll also find an AI restorer there, replacing the computer frame.
  - rscadd: Cameras aren't all X-ray anymore. The AI won't be able to see what room
      you are in if there's no normal camera inside that room or if there's no X-ray
      camera nearby..
  - rscadd: Cameras get upgrades! Currently there's X-ray, EMP-Proof and Motion. You'll
      find the EMP-Proof and Motion cameras in the normal places (Singularity Pen
      &amp; EVA), the new X-ray cameras can be found in the Dormitory and Bathrooms,
      plus some extra ones to invade your privacy. See if you can smash them all.
  - tweak: 'Alien Larva can bite simple animals (see: Ian, Runtime, Mice) to kill
      them and gain a small amount of growing points.'
  - tweak: Space travel was tweaked to be more random when changing Z levels. This
      will stop people and items from being stuck in an infinite loop, as they will
      eventually hit something to make them stop.

  - rscadd: '-Changes flour from an item to a container-held reagent. All recipes
      have been updated to use 5 units of reagent flour for every item required previously.   This
      has a few advantages: The 16(!) sacks of flour previously in the kitchen cabinet
      have been condensed to an equivalent 3 sacks. Beer is now brewable with universal
      enzyme, and converting lots of wheat into flour should be less tedious. Also,
      flour grenades, etc.  Because of this, flour is now obtained from the all-in-one
      blender rather than the processor, and spaghetti noodles are made with 5 units
      of flour in the microwave.'
  Giacom:
  - tweak: Removed cameras from bots (NOT BORGS). They weren't working well with freelook
      and I felt that since they weren't used at all, they wouldn't be missed.

  Carn:
  - bugfix: Added an additional check to stop changelings sharing powers/becomming
      un-absorbable/etc by absorbing eachother and then rejuvinating from death.
  - tweak: Cloaked Aliens are now slightly easier to see, so they should avoid strongly
      lit areas when possible. They can still lay down to become even stealthier though.
      Let me know what you think, it's only a minor sprite change.

  'Important note for server hosts!:':
  - experiment: The file /code/defines/hub.dm was moved into /code/hub.dm. To get
      your server back on the hub, open /code/hub.dm and set the hub variables again.
      Sorry for the inconvenience.

  Carn:
  - experiment: <font color="purple"><b>New Hotkeys (Trial period)</b>. Details can
      be found in the help menu or via the hotkeys-help verb. It's all client-side.
      It shouldn't intefere with regular controls (except ctrl+A, ctrl+S, ctrl+D and
      ctrl+W).</font>

  Carn:
  - rscadd: F5 is now a hotkey for adminghosting. F8 toggles ghost-like invisibility
      for admins.
  - tweak: Catatonia makes you fall down. Admins appear braindead when admin-ghosting.
  - tweak: '"Set-observe"/"Set-play" renamed and merged into "Aghost".'
  - tweak: '"Lay down/Get up" renamed to "Rest"'
  - bugfix: Closets can't be sold on the supply shuttle anymore
  - bugfix: Fixed all dat light
  Cheridan:
  - imageadd: Metroids have been replaced with Rorobeasts. Roros are strange latex-based
      lifeforms that hate light, fun, and gloves.

  - rscadd: You can now dispense, remove and retag sort junctions properly!

  - bugfix: Hopefully fixed the stop midis button. It should now stop any midis that
      are currently playing.

  - bugfix: Cutting tower caps in hand no longer deletes the wood, and planks now
      auto stack

  Giacom:
  - tweak: Airlocks now use the Environmental power channel, since they are <b>air</b>locks
      after-all. Meaning, when power is low the airlocks will still work until the
      environmental channel on the APC is turned off. This applies to all the door
      control buttons too. Pipe meters now use the environmental power channel. If
      you have any comments have this change, please let me know in the feedback section
      of the forums.
