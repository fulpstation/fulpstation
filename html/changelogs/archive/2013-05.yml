  - tweak: As a part of the most recent round of budget cuts, toolboxes will now be
      made with a cheaper but heavier alloy. HR reminds employees to avoid being struck
      with toolboxes, as toolbox-related injuries are not covered under the company's
      standard health plan.

  - rscadd: SecHuds now check for valid clearance before allowing you to change someone's
      arrest status. There is only one way to bypass the ID check, and its not the
      usual way.

  - tweak: "Nanotrasen seeks to further cut operating costs on experimental cyborg\
      \ units. \n\t\t<br/>-Cyborg chassis will now be made from a cheaper but less\
      \ durable design. \n\t\t<br/>-RCDs found on engineering models have been replaced\
      \ with a smaller model to make room for a metal rods module.\n\t\t<br/>-Cyborg\
      \ arms will no longer be long enough to allow for self-repairs.\n\t\t<br/>NOTE:\
      \ A cyborg's individual modules have been found to become non-operational should\
      \ the unit sustain too much structural damage."

  - rscdel: CentCom announced some minor restructuring within Space Station 13's command
      structure. Most notable of these changes is the removal of the Head of Personnel's
      access to the security radio channel. CentCom officials have stated the intention
      was to make the HoP's role more specialized and less partial towards security.
