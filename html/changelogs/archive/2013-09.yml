  - rscadd: We at Nanotrasen would like to assure you that we know the pain of waiting
      five minutes for the emergency shuttle to be dispatched in a high-alert situation
      due to our confirmation-of-distress policy. Therefore, we have amended our confirmation-of-distress
      policy so that, in the event of a red alert, the distress confirmation period
      is shortened to three minutes and we will hurry in preparing the shuttle for
      transit. This totals to 6 minutes, in hope that it will give our <b>very expensive
      equipment</b> a better chance of recovery.

  - bugfix: You can no longer strip people through windows and windoors
  - bugfix: You can open doors by hand even if there is a firedoor in the way, making
      firedoor+airlock no longer an unbeatable combination
  - rscadd: Ghosts can now click on anything to examine it, or double click to jump
      to a turf.  Double clicking a mob, bot, or (heaven forbid) singularity/Nar-Sie
      will let you follow it.  Double clicking your own corpse re-enters it.
  - rscadd: AI can double click a mob to follow it, as well as double clicking turfs
      to jump.
  - rscadd: Ventcrawling mobs can alt-click a vent to start ventcrawling.
  - wip: Telekinesis is now part of the click system.  You can click on buttons, items,
      etc, without having a telekinetic throw in hand; the throw will appear when
      you click on something you can move (with your mind).

  - tweak: Juggernaut's ablative armor has been adjusted. They have a greater chance
      to reflect lasers however on reflection they take half damage instead of no
      damage, basically this adjustment means you should be able to kill a Juggernaut
      with two laser guns instead of four! Also their reflection spread has been greatly
      widened, enjoy the lightshow
  - rscadd: Cargo can now order exile implants.
  - tweak: Checking a collector's last power output via analyzers has been moved to
      multitools, because that actually made sense (betcha didn't know this existed,
      I know I didn't)
  - rscadd: Analyzers can now be used to check the gas level of the tank in a loaded
      radiation collector (yay no more crowbars), you can also use them on pipes to
      check gas levels (yay no more pipe meters)

  - rscadd: Mobs can now be lit on fire. Wearing a full firesuit (or similar) will
      protect you. Extinguishers, Showers, Space, Cryo, Resisting, being splashed
      with water can all extinguish you. Being splashed with fuel/ethanol/plasma makes
      you more flammable. Water makes you less flammable.
