  ATHATH:
  - balance: The toxin healing from the fiziver chem has been brought down to a much
      more sane level and metabs 25% as fast as previous.
  - balance: The fiziver chem's damage-multiplying effect now gains potency at a much
      faster rate (under most normal/sane circumstances), but caps out at making you
      take 3x as much brute, burn, oxygen, and stamina damage as you normally would.
  - bugfix: The fiziver chem now properly undoes its modifications to the stamina_mod
      value. Before this change, taking a 10u pill of fiziver could render your body
      over 2.5x as vulnerable to stamina damage for the rest of the round.
  - balance: The fiziver chem's overdose effect is no longer incredibly pathetic.
      Instead of dealing a pitiful amount of damage and then completely purging the
      fiziver chem from your system, the fiziver chem's overdose effect now has a
      50% chance each tick to deal 0.2 brute damage and 0.2 burn damage (which will,
      of course, be amplified by the normal damage-increasing effect of fivizer).

      are standing in visible amounts of plasma gas.
