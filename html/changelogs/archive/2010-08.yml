  - unknown: <strong>Hydroponics/Botany Added</strong> Credit goes to Skie and the
      folks over at the independent opensource SS13 branch, this is their code. It's
      lacking a lot, but it's a great start!
  - unknown: Way more tweaks than I can remember. Shouldn't wait so long between changelog
      updates.

      singularity code.

      are totally different now.
  - unknown: Engine Monitor PDA app is now Power Monitor PDA app, and actually works.
  - unknown: AI State Laws verb now allows the AI to choose which laws to state, in
      case of traitor AIs or laws ordering it not to state them.  Hopefully this will
      cut down on 'OMG THE AI IS COPYING AND PASTING' metagaming.
  - unknown: Power Monitor circuitboard isn't mislabeled as Mass Driver Control any
      more.
  - unknown: <strong>Traitor and Rev-head clowns lose the clumsiness gene</strong>
      - this should make trying to flash people in Rev mode less of an exercise in
      frustration.

      and bloodstained clothing and equipment.

      area is now used as a lockerroom to replace the old one which was displaced
      by Hydroponics.

      the crew.
  - unknown: <strong>LIBRARY</strong>  A library has been added to the station in
      the escape arm in order to educate the crew.  The new Librarian job is available
      to manage it.  Crewmembers can request and read books, or write and bind their
      own books for upload to a persistent database.
  - unknown: The supply of flashbangs available from Security has been reduced to
      cut down on people constantly flashbanging the escape shuttle.

      of valuable AI personality data in the event of catastrophic station damage.
