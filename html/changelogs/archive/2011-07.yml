  Agouri:
  - unknown: Sleepers are now able to heal every kind of damage. Drag your ass to
      medbay and ask a doctor to get you in one.
  - unknown: A lil' bit faster cloning (about 30% faster) due to popular demand.
  - unknown: Sleepers are now all located in the inner part of medbay, except for
      the examination room one.
  - unknown: Added Dermaline, burn-healing drug that outpowers kelotane (and kelotane
      is getting a major nerf, so be sure to know how to get this). Recipe is on the
      wiki if you need to make it.
  - unknown: Drugs no longer heal or metabolise when injected in dead bodies, fuck.
      Thank god you guys missed this major bug or we'd have cloning-by-injecting-healing-drugs.
  - unknown: "Reminder to coders: Goddamn, update the changelog.\n\t"
  Doohl:
  - unknown: '<font color="red">A new alien race: Metroids!</font> They are a mostly
      non-sentient race of jellyfish-like organisms that float in the air and feed
      on the life energy of other organisms. While most Metroids have never shown
      signs of self-awareness, they do exhibit signs of basic logic and reasoning
      skills as well as very sophisticated perception. Nanotrasen has shipped two
      baby Metroids for the xenobiology department. They should be handled with the
      utmost care - they are some of the deadliest beings in the known universe!'
  - unknown: 'R&amp;D gets a new toy: the freeze gun. Despite popular belief, this
      will not literally freeze things!'
  - unknown: Every single chemical reagent has been assigned a color.
  - unknown: You can now see beakers fill up with chemicals. You can also observe
      how the colors mix inside the beakers. Spray bottles also will also show the
      color of whatever you're spraying.
  - unknown: Added a timestamp to combat logs.
  - unknown: Non-insulated gloves now need to be wrapped in wire in order to be electrified.
  - unknown: You can now shoot at people on the ground by simply clicking on the tile
      they're on.
  - unknown: 'Changeling husks are now uncloneable. To clarify: when a changeling
      sucks out a victim''s DNA, the victim is said to become a "husk".'
  Errorage:
  - unknown: Increased environmental damage by a factor of 1.5.
  - unknown: Made firesuits a lot more resistant to heat. Previously, they stopped
      protecting at around 4,500 degrees. They now go up to around 10,000 (which is
      also the temperature which the floor starts melting)
  - unknown: Edited the quartermaster's office a bit.
  - unknown: Cargo technicians now have access to a cargo ordering console.
  - unknown: Added different-colored hardhats. The CE gets a white hardhat.
  Firecage:
  - unknown: A whole bunch of new drinks and food. Seriously, there's alot!
  - unknown: New weapons such as the shock revolver and large energy crossbow.

  Matty:
  - unknown: New engineering backpacks. Enjoy!
  Microwave:

  - unknown: Contains a score of monkey cubes, which you apply water to create monkies.
      Nanotrasen provides only the finest technology!
  - unknown: You can order monkey crates from the cargo bay. They contain monkey boxes.
  - unknown: Changed the amount of labels labelers have to 30. 10 was too low and
      30 should not be <i>too</i> griefy.
  - unknown: Maximum label text length increased from 10 to 64.
  - unknown: You can no longer label people because they can just peel the labels
      off. Sorry, clowns!
  - unknown: Jelly dooonnuuuutsss! Happy birthday, officers!
  - unknown: Made xenomeat not give any nutrition.
  - unknown: Added some new reagents.
  - unknown: Made it possible to feed monkies and xenos things, as well as making
      it possible for them to eat themselves (please don't read that too literally).
  - unknown: Added in synthiflesh.
  - unknown: Plasma is now not used in reactions, instead, is treated as a catalyst
      that is not used up. This only applies to certain reactions.
  - unknown: Made it possible to grind more things in the chemistry grinder.
  Muskets:
  - unknown: The prepackaged songs (Space Asshole, Cuban Pete, Darkest Honk, etc)
      have been removed. This doesn't mean admins can't play midis, this just gets
      rid of a lot of unnecessary download time.
  Rastaf.Zero:
  - unknown: 'Botanists get a new toy: Biogenerator. Insert biological items, recieve
      biological items.'

  Trubble Bass updated:
  - unknown: Hat crates. Hat Station 13.
  Uhangi:
  - unknown: Traitors can now purchase syndicate balloons, which serve no purpose
      other than to blow your cover. For a limited time only, you can get them at
      a bargain price - just 10 telecrystals!
  - unknown: Removed security shotguns from the armory. No fun allowed.
  - unknown: Changed some bullet damage stuff.
  Urist McDorf:

  /tg/station team:
  - unknown: ' Day of Forum revival!'
  Agouri updated:
  - unknown: I was always bothered by how unprofessional it was of Nanotransen (in
      before &gt;Nanotransen &gt;professionalism) to just lay expensive spacesuits
      in racks and just let them be. Well, no more. Introducing...
  - unknown: Suit Storage Units. Rumored to actually be repurposed space radiators,
      these wondrous machines will store any kind of spacesuit in a clean and sterile
      environment.
  - unknown: The user can interact with the unit in various ways. You can start a
      UV cauterisation cycle to disinfect its contents, effectively sterilising and
      cleaning eveyrthing from the suits/helmets stored inside.
  - unknown: A sneaky yordle can also hide in it, if he so desires, or hack it, or
      lock it or do a plethora of shady stuff with it. Beware, though, there's plenty
      of dangerous things you can do with it, both to you and your target.
  - unknown: The Unit's control panel can be accessed by screwdriving it. That's all
      I'm willing to say, I'd like to let the players find out what each hack option
      does and doesn't. Will add more stuff later.
  - unknown: Added Command Space suit, Chief Engineer space suit and Chief Medical
      Officer spacesuit (In a new space that you'll probably notice by yourself) to
      make it easier for you to look like a special snowflake.
  - unknown: EVA and CMO office modified to accomodate the new suits and SSUs. Look,
      I'm not a competent mapper, okay? Fuck you too. A mapper is strongly recommended
      to rearrange my half assed shit.
  - unknown: Soda cans, cigarette packets, cigarettes and cigars as well as bullet
      casings are now considered trash and can be picked up by the trashbag. Now you
      can annoy the janitor even more!
  - unknown: 'Sprite credit goes to Alex Jones, his portfolio can be found here: <a
      href="http://bspbox.com/">http://bspbox.com</a>. Thanks a lot, bro.'
  - unknown: With the recent forum fuss and all that, I've got a thread to specifically
      contain  rants and bug reports about this update. <a href="http://tgstation13.servehttp.com/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=3&amp;t=5569&amp;p=45549&amp;sid=a4a96f5b0e896cd3e3f7c1db73f09f1b#p45549">Click

  Doohl updated:
  - unknown: 'Bugfix: Metroids should never "shut down" and just die in a corner when
      they begin starving. And so, hungry Metroids are a force to be feared.'
  - unknown: The Cargo computers now have the ability to cancel pending orders to
      refund credits. This was put in place so that idiots couldn't waste all the
      cargo points and run off. However, if the shuttle is en route to the station
      you won't be able to cancel orders.
  - unknown: 'Bugfix: the manifest has been fixed! Additionally, the manfiest is now
      updated realtime; job changes and new arrivals will be automatically updated
      into the manifest. Joy!'
  - unknown: Metroids, when wrestled off of someone's head or beaten off, now get
      stunned for a few seconds.
  Errorage updated:
  - unknown: Hopefully fixed the derelict 'hotspots'. Derelict medbay has also been
      fixed.
  Uhangi updated:
  - unknown: EVA redesigned
  - unknown: An electropack is now available once again on the prison station

  Doohl updated:
  - unknown: 'New virus: Retrovirus. It basically screws over your DNA.'
  - unknown: "You can now do CTRL+MOVEMENT to face any direction you want. See those\
      \ chairs in Medbay and the Escape Wing? You can do CTRL+EAST to actually RP\
      \ that you're sitting on them. Is this cool or what?!\n\t"
  Rockdtben updated:
  - unknown: 'Bugfix: Fixed a bug where you could dupe diamonds'
  Superxpdude Updated:
  - unknown: Engineer and CE space helmets now have built-in lights.
