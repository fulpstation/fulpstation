  - rscadd: Nanotrasen scientists have released a Heads-Up-Display (HUD) upgrade for
      all AI and Cyborg units! Cyborgs have had Medical sensors and a Security datacore
      integrated into their core hardware, replacing the need for a specific module.
  - rscadd: AI units are now able to have suit sensor or crew manifest data displayed
      to them as a visual overlay. When viewing a crewmember with suit sensors set
      to health monitoring, the health status will be available on the AI's medical
      HUD. In Security mode, the role as printed on the crewmember's ID card will
      be displayed to the AI.
  - rscadd: Any entity with a Security or Medical HUD active will recieve appropriate
      messages on that HUD.
