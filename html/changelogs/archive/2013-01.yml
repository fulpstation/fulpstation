      are also now displayed when examining.
  - tweak: The job selection screen has been changed a little to hopefully make making
      changes there easier.

      instead of just straight damage.

      has changed clothing.

      on humans in most intents, but they should be pretty much the same.

      models with seed-extraction tech. Activate with via right-click menu or Objects
      verb tab.
  - rscadd: 'Obtaining grass tiles works a bit different now: grass is harvested as
      a normal plant item, clicking on it in-hand produces the tile.'

      old slimes.
