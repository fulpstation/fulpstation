  - balance: Most energy sword-like weapons have had their demolition_mod increased
      to 1.5x (from 1x). This affects damage vs. robots, objects, structures, etc.
      Energy scalpels did not receive this buff.

  - bugfix: You can now revive 'basic mobs' with a Lazarus Injector, such as dogs,
      cows, axolotls, or carp.
  - bugfix: The same category of mobs can also now be effected by the Runic Golem
      Dominate spell.
  - bugfix: Basic Mobs will switch target if they can no longer attack their current
      target; meaning that if you become a Bileworm's friend it will stop attacking
      you.
  - balance: Mobs injected with the Lazarus Injector while it is EMPed will no longer
      attack other mobs revived by EMPed Lazarus Injectors.
  - balance: The carp migration event won't trigger if there are fewer than 12 players.
