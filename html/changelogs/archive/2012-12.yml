  Giacom:
  - rscadd: Added a new artefact called the "Staff of Animation". You can get it in
      the Wizard's Spellbook. It will animate objects and items, but not machines,
      to fight for you. The animated objects will not attack the bearer of the staff
      which animates them, meaning if you lose your staff, or if it gets stolen, your
      minions will turn on you.

  Giacom:
  - rscadd: The wizard's fireball spell is once again dumbfire. It will fire in the
      direction of the wizard instead of having to choose from a list of targets and
      then home in on them.

  - tweak: Examining humans now works a bit differently. Some external suits and helmets
      can hide certain pieces of clothing so you don't see them when examining. Glasses
      are also now displayed when examining.
  - tweak: The job selection screen has been changed a little to hopefully make making
      changes there easier.
