  ATHATH:
  - tweak: Made the alkali perspiration symptom's water reaction explosion effect
      much easier to proc.
  - balance: The alkali perspiration symptom's stage speed 8 threshold effect now
      also increases the potency of the explosion effect to a "heavy" level on the
      host's tile, in addition to its previous effect(s).
  - balance: The alkali perspiration symptom's water reaction explosion effect can
      now occur in both stage 4 and in stage 5 (instead of only in stage 5).
  - bugfix: Fixes a bug that would cause the alkali perspiration symptom's water reaction
      explosion effect to trigger the alkali perspiration symptom's Alkali_fire_stage_5()
      effect a second time in a single cycle.
  - tweak: Slightly modifies the alkali perspiration symptom's threshold effect descriptions
      to be slightly more clear about what its threshold effects actually do.
  - balance: The Mutate spell's effects are now permanent (until/unless you forget
      or otherwise lose the spell) if you purchase it five times.

  Touches Medbay... Again...:
  - rscadd: Keep their pants on! Now Tend Wounds can be done through clothing!
  - balance: It is less effective to perform Tend Wounds with clothes on.
  actioninja:
  - bugfix: changeling and chameleon should properly copy mob overlays again.
  - bugfix: prison jumpsuit has correct sprite
  bgobandit:
  - tweak: Graffiti by a non-tagger counts as bad art.
  bobbahbrown:
  - bugfix: Dynamic mode ruleset will now respect your player preferences when selecting
      antag candidates
  - code_imp: Fixed 9 instances of incorrect not-in-list expressions.
  cacogen:
  - tweak: HoP can now delete the latest ticket
  - bugfix: HoP ticket messages should now be visible when the ticket is held
  - imageadd: Added condiment bottle reagent overlays for reagents without special
      bottle sprites
  - rscadd: Made it so you can rename or change the description of condiment bottles
      with a pen
  - balance: You can no longer tell the main or only reagent in a condiment bottle
      through the description. This is in line with other reagent containers.
  - spellcheck: Fixed some typos/punched descriptions up a little
  - tweak: Sprites of roundstart condiment containers (e.g. salt, milk, flour) are
      no longer static and change based on the reagent with the largest volume as
      well now
  - tweak: Sugar comes in a bag rather than a bottle

      are the largest reagent in them

2019-09-03:
  ATH1909:
  - rscadd: The regenerative coma symptom has a new resistance 4 threshold effect!
      Said threshold effect will give hosts of the symptom's virus the TRAIT_STABLECRIT
      trait if its threshold is met.
  - bugfix: An obscure, probably never reported before bug that may or may not exist
      involving sentient diseases and the self-respiration symptom should be fixed
      now (if it even existed in the first place).
  ATHAHTH:
  - balance: Androids and synths have been added to the lists of races available from
      pride mirrors and magic mirrors.
  ATHATH:
  - tweak: The confusion symptom now noticeably confuses you.
  - tweak: The confusion symptom's transmission 6 threshold effect now actually affects
      how much the symptom increases your confused value by (instead of affecting
      the cap that the symptom can bring it to, which is plenty high enough by default).
  - tweak: The dizziness symptom now actually makes you noticeably dizzy (and has
      a cap for how dizzy it can make you).
  - tweak: The dizziness symptom's transmission 6 threshold effect now makes your
      screen look "druggy" all of the time (only once its virus reaches a high enough
      stage, of course), instead of only occasionally.
  - tweak: The hallucigen symptom's stealth 4 threshold effect now continues to give
      you positive messages instead of bad ones at stage 5. Before this tweak, meeting
      that stealth threshold would actually cause bad messages to appear MORE often
      at stage 5 than if you hadn't met it.
  - tweak: Pretty much completely reworked the narcolepsy symptom so that it now uses
      the "drowsyness" (yes, that's how it's spelled in the code; no, I don't know
      why it's misspelled like that in the code) status effect instead of a confusing
      mess of ticking counters that rarely actually put you to sleep.
  - tweak: The narcolepsy symptom's transmission 7 threshold effect now only requires
      transmission 4 no longer causes its virus to occasionally deal negligible amounts
      of stamina damage. Instead, it now causes the host to periodically yawn, spreading
      its virus whenever they do so.
  - tweak: The narcolepsy symptom's resistance 10 threshold effect is now a stage
      speed 10 threshold effect.
  - tweak: The narcolepsy symptom's activation frequencies have been tweaked a bit
      to make the symptom less threatening (albeit still quite potent) without its
      stage speed 10 (formerly a resistance 10) threshold effect.
  - balance: The nacrolepsy symptom now adds 0 to its virus's transmission stat (upped
      from -4).
  - bugfix: Fixed a bug that could cause the confusion symptom to lower your confusion
      value if you had a high confusion value when it activated.
  Akrilla:
  - rscdel: Removes crayon eating colour changes from the crayons in crayon packs.
      Rainbow/mime unaffected.

2019-09-06:
  ATHATH and ExcessiveUseOfCobblestone:
  - balance: Earthsblood's healing has been changed; its burn and brute healing rates
      have been increased, but its oxygen, stamina and clone healing rates have been
      lowered.
  - balance: Earthsblood heals you less before its 26th cycle in you, but also deals
      less brain damage to you before its 26th cycle in you as well.
  - balance: Earthsblood now gives you the pacifism trait temporarily while it is
      in your system.
  - balance: If you are a human, the earthsblood overdose effect now, in addition
      to its previous effects, gives you a pacifism brain trauma with a resilience
      of TRAUMA_RESILIENCE_SURGERY. If you already had a pacifism brain trauma with
      a resilience of TRAUMA_RESILIENCE_BASIC (for some reason), it will increase
      the resilience of that brain trauma to TRAUMA_RESILIENCE_SURGERY. This pacifism
      brain trauma is NOT taken away when the earthsblood chem leaves your system.
  - rscadd: After its 25th cycle in you, earthsblood has a 10% chance per tick of
      on_mob_life to make you say a random hippie-related message.

2019-09-10:
  ATHATH:
  - balance: The OD effect of the earthsblood chemical now deals no damage before
      cycle 26, a net 1 point of toxin damage per tick (factoring in the toxin healing
      from earthsblood's normal effect(s)) from cycles 26 to 100, and a net 3 points
      of toxin damage per tick (factoring in the toxin healing from earthsblood's
      normal effect(s)) after cycle 100.
  - bugfix: The pacifism trauma application part of OD effect of the earthsblood chemical
      is less shitcode-y now and should now work on monkeys (and other carbons with
      brains) too (instead of just on humans).
  Anarcho-Capitalistabital-by:
  - rscadd: In General, Buffs healing thoroughput of C2s. You can stop paying your
      cloners overtime now!
  - tweak: The roundstart C2 methods are now diluted with a new reagent, Granibitaluri.
  - tweak: The borghypo now can switch to "microdosing", which is 2u transfer via
      AltClick

      rainbow slime extracts
  - bugfix: injecting blue slime extracts with water now creates foam, not fluorosurfactant
  ExcessiveUseOfCobblestone:
  - rscadd: Plasma now "boils" at 50C. This means you will need to heat the liquid
      form up to make it into a gas (previously you could just splash it)
  - tweak: containers that halt reactions (IE cryostasis beakers) will keep reagents
      at a set temperature.
  - bugfix: Plasma will no longer summon gas whenever transferring via syringe. AKA
      you can now do xenobio again.
  - bugfix: Plasma can no longer be cheesed grenade-style by heating the beaker. It
      will now require reaction/pyrotechnics.
  - code_imp: Reagents now have the framework to perform different effects on temperature
      change.

  cacogen:
  - rscadd: Can lock attributes on character creation (e.g. hair style, eye color)
      screen so when character is randomised on the screen using "Random Body" or
      spawns randomised using "Always Random Body" they stay the same
  - rscdel: Removed random name enforcement when using "Always Random Species" as
      it discourages its use and manually chosen species don't have this naming restriction
  - tweak: Having "Always Random Body" on on the character creation screen won't constantly
      refresh your character anytime you change an attribute. Same for "Always Random
      Name" for your name and "Always Random Species" for your species.
  - rscadd: Can selectively spawn with random gender, age, backpack style, jumpsuit
      style (i.e. suit or skirt), maybe a couple of other shits I forgot that weren't
      previously affected by "Always Random Body"
  - spellcheck: Changed all instances of the word hairstyle as multiple words in the

      as a coder for the word to be spelled properly
  - code_imp: Adds defines for all randomisable features

  - soundadd: support for equip sounds, with jumpsuits and toolbelts serving as a

2019-09-14:
  ATH1909:
  - tweak: Changed the default name of /datum/reagent/colorful_reagent/powder to "mundane
      powder" (from "crayon powder"), to better reflect that it can't color anything
      (its subtypes still can, of course) and that /datum/reagent/colorful_reagent/powder
      isn't found in most crayons anymore.
  - tweak: Changed the names of the subtypes of /datum/reagent/colorful_reagent/powder
      so that they no longer mention crayons/"crayon powder".
  - tweak: Changes the wordings of the descriptions of /datum/reagent/colorful_reagent/powder
      and its subtypes to be less weird (and to mention that invisible powder and
      mundane powder can't color anything). This change should also make the description
      of mundane powder no longer state that it can color things the "none" color.
  ATHATH:
  - balance: Omega weed has lost its haloperidol, capsaicin, barber's aid, itching
      powder, and histamine chemical production traits. In exchange, it's received
      the nicotine production trait as an additional chemical production trait. The
      chemical production traits that were in omega weed before this change but were
      not mentioned in the above list are still in omega weed.
  - balance: The list of chemical production traits of rainbow weed has been changed
      from 15% mindbreaker toxin and 35% lipolicide to 5% colorful reagent, 3% psicodine,
      10% happiness, 10% mindbreaker toxin, and 15% lipolicide. This should make ingesting
      rainbow weed change your character's color, but should also make 100 potency
      rainbow weed highly addictive.
  - balance: The extradimensional orange has received the 15% haloperidol chemical
      production trait that omega weed used to have.
  - balance: The base damage dealt (before modifiers) by stepping on a d4 without
