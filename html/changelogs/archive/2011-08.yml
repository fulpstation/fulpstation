  - unknown: The smoke chemistry recipe has been upgraded! You can lace smoke with
      chemicals that can bathe people or enter their lungs through inhalation. Yes,
      this means you can make chloral hydrate smoke bombs. No, this doesn't mean you
      can make napalm smoke or foam smoke.

  - unknown: Chaplains can now select different bible icons when they start. The selection
      is applied globally and the library's bible printer will print the same bibles.

      cooldown. One minute may seem a little extreme, but it is necessary to prevent
      people from spamming the fuck out of everything with 100,000,000,000,000 carbon-copy
      bibles.
  - unknown: Tweaked Metroids a bit; they are slightly more aggressive and become
