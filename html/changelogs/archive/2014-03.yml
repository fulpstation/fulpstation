  Giacom:
  - rscadd: Added two new plasma-level disease symptoms, both are very !FUN! and mess
      with your genetics.
  - tweak: Virologists now only need to use a single unit of virus food, mutagen or
      plasma to generate symptoms. You can take a single unit by using a dropper,
      if you change its unit transfer amount in the object tab..
  - tweak: Changed the map to make it harder to escape from the Labor Camp. Please
      continue using it.
  Miauw:

2014-03-14:
  Ikarrus and Nienhaus:

      senior station officers. A new uniform for Heads of Personnel will be shipped

  Steelpoint/Validsalad:
  - tweak: After a review with CentCom, all Security Officers will now begin their
      shifts with a Stun Baton in their backpack. To avoid inflating costs however
      all Stun Batons have been removed from Security lockers except from the brig.
  - imageadd: After decades of usage CentCom has replaced the Security Uniform, Armor,
      Belt and Helmet with a newer, more modern design.
2014-03-17:
  Giacom:
  - tweak: Machines that had their programming overriden by a Malf AI will no longer
      attack loyal cyborgs; they will still attack cyborgs that aren't loyal, to the
      Malf AI that hacked them, though.
  - tweak: You only require a single unit of blood to mutate viruses now, instead
      of 5.
2014-03-18:
  Ikarrus:
  - rscadd: NT R&amp;D; releases AI Patch version 2553.03.18, allowing all Nanotrasen
      AIs to override the access restrictions on any airlock in case of emergency.
      Nanotrasen airlocks have been outfitted with new amber warning lights that will
      flash while the override is active. Should maintenance teams need to restore
      an airlock's restrictions without using the AI, pulsing the airlock's ID Scanner
      wire will reset the override.
2014-03-22:
  Giacom:
  - rscadd: Gravity is no longer beamed from CentCom! Instead, there is a new gravity
      generator stored near Engineering that will provide all the gravity for the
      station and the z level. Please remember that it gives off a lot of radiation
      when charging or discharging, so wear protection.
  MrPerson:
  - rscadd: Added a new, somewhat experimental system to delete things. This is basically
      a port from /vg/, so big thanks to N3X15.
  - rscadd: As a result, bombs and the singularity should be much less laggy.
  - experiment: There may be issues with "phantom objects" or other problems with
      stuff that's suppoed to be deleted or objects interacting with deleted objects.
      Please report any issues right away!
2014-03-25:
  Ikarrus:
  - tweak: "A security review committee has approved an update to all Nanotrasen airlocks\
      \ to better resist cryptographic attacks by the enemy.\n\t\t\t<br/><br/>*New\
      \ internal wiring will be able to withstand attacks, and panel wires will no\
      \ longer be left unusable after an attack.\n\t\t\t<br/>*Welding tools will now\
      \ be able to cut through welded doors that have been damaged.\n\t\t\t<br/>*Damaged\
      \ electronics are now removable and replaceable following standard procedure.\n\
      \t\t\t<br/>*Airlocks will not be able to operate autonomously until the electronics\
      \ are replaced.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"
  - imageadd: Hair sprites have been given a visual lift. For best results, set your
      hair color to be slightly lighter than how you want it to look. For dark hair,
      do not use a color darker than 80% black.

  Aranclanos:
  - tweak: Workaround with the click cooldowns. They should feel faster. If you think
      that anything needs a click cooldown (like grilles, mobs, etc.), report it to
      me.
  - experiment: Here's the fun part, this is a test for the community and players,
      I hope I won't be forced to revert this and hear "this is why we can't have
      nice things". Again, if anything needs a cooldown, report it to me. Have fun
      with your fast clicks spessmans.
2014-03-31:
  Ikarrus:
  - rscadd: Fabricator blueprints for cyborg parts have been updated to allow the
      debugging of cyborg units prior to boot. To access the debug functions, assemble
      a cyborg following standard procedure. Before inserting the MMI, use a multitool
      on the cyborg body. Note that this update also moves designation data into the
      system files, so pens can no longer be used to name cyborgs.
  MrPerson:
  - rscadd: Toggling the "Play admin midis" preference will pause any playing songs.
      Turning midis back on will resume the current song where it was.
  - rscadd: If there's a song playing while you have midis off and you then turn midis
      on, the current song will begin playing for you.
