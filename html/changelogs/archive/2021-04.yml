      by the RPD can be colored (from pumps to connectors, from pipes to manifolds),
      if you leave them GREY they can connect to every other color. Color adapters
      can be colored, but they'll still connect two pipes with different colors. BUILDABLE
      machines are GREY (thermomachines, cryo, HFR) so be aware of this add:-Trying
      to go across another smart pipe will now build a bridge pipe automatically already
      colored of the color you choose, so you don't have to place it yourself anymore
      (is still available in the RPD tho) add:-ALL binary components, layer manifolds,
      color adapters and bridge pipe can be put ONTOP of a smart pipe, but not on
      another of these. Smart pipes can't be placed on top of these pipes, so you
      have to build them first. add:-Lcrossings can't be made anymore (sorry y'all
      i tryed, if someone have a way of doing them ping me on discord) add:-REMEMBER
      you still have 5 layers to go, these rules apply to the same layer pipes, so
