  - rscadd: You can now make restraints from cable. It takes 15 lengths of cable to
      make a pair of restraints, they are applied the same way as handcuffs and have
      the same effects. It however only takes 30s to remove them by using the resist
      verb or button. You can also remove them from someone by using wirecutters on
      the handcuffed person.
  - rscadd: 'Added four new cable colors: pink, orange, cyan and white. Engineer belts
      spawn with yellow, red or orange cables while toolboxes and tool closets spawn
      with all 8 colors.'

  Carn:
  - rscadd: Alien hunters will now cloak when using the 'stalk' movement intent. Whilst
      cloaked they will use up their plasma reserves. They can however cloak as long
      as they like. Using the Lay-down verb will allow them to remain cloaked without
      depleting their plasma reserves,  hence allowing them to lay ambushes for unsuspecting
      prey. Should a hunter attack anybody, or get knocked down in any way,  they
      will become visible. Hopefully this allows for more strategic/stealthy gameplay
      from aliens. On the other hand, I may have totally  screwed the balance so feedback/other-ideas
      are welcome.
  - rscdel: 'Removed the invisibility verb from the alien hunter caste. '
