  - rscadd: Revamped blob mode and the blob random event to spawn a player controlled
      overmind that can expand the blob and upgrade pieces that perform particular
      functions. This will use resources which the core can slowly generate or you
      can place blob pieces that will give you more resources.

  - rscadd: A new item has been added to the syndicate catalog. The AI detector is
      a device disguised as a multitool; it is not only able to be used as a real
      multitool but when it detects an AI looking at it, or it's holder, it will turn
      red to indicate to the holder that he should cease supiscious activities. A
      great and cheap, to produce, tool for undercover operations involving an AI
      as the security system.

  - tweak: 'Summary of my recent changes: Added a muzzle and a box of Prisoner ID
      cards to the perma wing, RnD can make a new combined gas mask with welding visor,
      added some atmos analyzers to atmospherics, air alarm circuit boards have their
      own sprites, package wrapped objects will now loop back round to the mail chute
      instead of auto-rerouting to disposals, and the detective and captain have access
      to securitrons through their PDA cartridges.'

  - rscadd: Instead of a level-up system where it is possible to acquire all the skills,
      each skill now costs 1 point, and you can pick up to 5.Husking people, instead
      of giving you more XP to buy skills, now gives you a skill reset, allowing you
      to pick new ones.
  - rscadd: DNA Extract Sting is now free, and is your main mode of acquiring DNA.
      You can hold up to 5 DNAs, and as you acquire more, the oldest one is removed.
      If you're currently using the oldest DNA strand, you will be required to transform
      before gaining more.
  - rscadd: New abilities! An UI indicator for chemical storage! Fun!
  Malkevin:
  - rscadd: Cultists now start with two words each, and the starting talisman no longer
      damages you when you use it

  - rscadd: Atmospherics now has its own hardsuit. Instead of radiation protection
      it offers fire protection.
