      even fall at all!). This has been corrected to allow you to punt them down to
      the intended height of TWO Z-Levels. Nifty, eh?

      There is now a 15% chance to show the opposite result, meaning you can use the
      report as a good guess of what is coming, but cannot rely on it.

  - bugfix: Fix rotation on wheelchairs to work properly.
  - refactor: Refactored the entire rotation component and all objects that use it.  Remove

      longer a ghetto advanced camera console.
