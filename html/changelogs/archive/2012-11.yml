  - tweak: Aliens now take x2 as much damage from fire based weaponary, instead of
      x1.5.

      more easily.
2012-11-02:
  Errorage:
  - rscadd: You can once again travel to the station, derelict, satellite and mining
      z-levels through space. You will also never loop into the same level on transition
      - So if you are exiting the derelict z-level, you will enter one of the other
      z-levels.

  Errorage:
  - rscadd: Being in an area with extremely low pressure will now deal some damage,
      if you're not protected.
  - rscadd: Space suits and the captain's armor now protect against pressure damage
  - tweak: Slightly lowered all environment damage intakes (temperature, oxygen deprevation)
      to make up for low pressure damage.
  - bugfix: Pressure protection finally works properly. Items that protect from pressure
      (firesuits, space suits, fire helmets, ...) will now properly protect. The pressure
      damage indicator will update properly based on the pressure effects on you.
      Black (low) and red (high) mean you are taking damage.
  - tweak: Slightly slowed down the speed at which your body temperature changes if
      you are in a very hot or very cold area. The speed at which you recover from
      an abnormal body temperature remains the same.

      bot. '

  - wip: "<font color=\"purple\"><u>Admin-ranks changes</u><br/>\n\t\tLots of changes.\
      \ This is just a brief summary of the most recent changes; still working on\
      \ proper documentation.<br/>\n\t\tAll admins have access to view-vars, player-panel(for\
      \ individual mobs), game panel and secrets panel. Most of the things on those\
      \ pages have their own rights requirements. For instance, you can only use event\
      \ orientated secrets in the secret panel if you have FUN rights. Debug secrets\
      \ if you have DEBUG rights. etc.<br/>\n\t\tSpawn xeno and toggle gravity procs\
      \ were moved into the secrets panel (fun).<br/>\n\t\t<a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/tgstation13/source/browse/trunk/config/admin_ranks.txt\"\
      >This</a> may help with understanding which flags do what. Unfortuanately it's\

      before reverting to the overlay you should have. This allows you to know you

  Kor:
  - rscadd: Added Exile Implants to the Gateway room. Someone implanted with an Exile
      Implant will be able to enter the away mission, but unable to return from it.
      Not only can they be used for getting rid of dangerous criminals, but revs/stationheads
      count as dead while on the away mission, and traitor/changeling/wizard assassination
      targets count as dead if they're on the away mission at round end, allowing
      for those objectives to be completed peacefully.
  - rscadd: Added medical hardsuits, sprited by Majorsephiroth. Two of them spawn
      in EVA. Their most unique/medical oriented feature is being able to hold a medkit
      in the suit storage slot, allowing you to easily access medicine while keeping
      your hands free.

      no longer has Security Equipment access.'
