      be reverted.

  - experiment: <b>Sacrifice Cult - Cult has received a massive overhaul to how it
      works, focusing more on cult magics and sacrificing unbelievers. The most important
      changes are:</b>
  - tweak: Cult starts off with alot more cultists, 6 cultists below 30 players and
      9 above. The HoP can no longer be a round start cultist but is still convertible.
  - tweak: Cultists start off with join, blood, self, and hell. These give the runes
      for the sacrifice and convert.
  - tweak: Conversions now require three cultists and converts no longer reward words,
      words must be obtained via sacrifice
  - tweak: Sacrificing players traps their soul in a soul stone, which can then be
      used on construct shells to implant the souls in them
  - tweak: Constructs shells can be summoned via a new rune (travel, hell, technology)
  - bugfix: You can no longer convert the sacrifice target, you dozzy sods
  - experiment: Summoning Narsie when she is not an objective leads to !!FUN!!
  - wip: Wrote a system to allow all mob types to be sacrificable - currently only
      corgis are in the new system
  - experiment: Holy Water will DECONVERT cultists, takes around 35 units and two
      minutes to succeed
  - experiment: Hitting a mob that contains holy water with a tome will convert that
      water to unholy water, conversely hitting any container that contains unholy
      water with a bible as chaplain will 'cleanse' the taint.
  - experiment: Unholy water works like a combination synaptazine and hyperzine, with
      a twist of branes dimarge and highly toxic to non-cultists
  - rscadd: Cargo can order a religious supplies crate - it contains flasks of holy
      water, candles, bibles, and robes
  - experiment: Cultists have an innate ability to communicate to the cult hive mind
      (BE AWARE - THIS DOES A LOT OF DAMAGE), cultists can also communicate via the
      new Commune option on their tomes (the Read Tome option has been shifted under
      the Notes option)
  MrStonedOne:
  - rscadd: Cyborgs can now use AI click shortcuts. (shift click on doors opens them,

  - rscadd: Certain Enemies of the Corporation have discovered a critical exploit
      in the firmware of several NanoTrasen robots that could prevent the safe shutdown
      of units corrupted by illegally modified ID cards, dubbed "cryptographic sequencers".
  - rscadd: NanoTrasen requires more research into this exploit, this we have issued
      a patch for AI and Cyborg software to simulate this malfunction. All NanoTrasen
      AI units are advised to only allow testing in a safe and contained environment.
      The robot can safely be reset at any time.
  - experiment: Unfortunately, a robot corrupted by a "cryptographic sequencer" still
      cannot be reset by any means. NanoTrasen urges regular maintenance and care
      of all robots to reduce replacement costs.
