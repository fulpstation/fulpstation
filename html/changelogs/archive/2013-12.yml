  - rscadd: 'A less annoying virology system! From now on, you can only get low level
      virus symptoms from virus food, medium level virus symptoms from unstable mutagen
      and high level virus symptoms from liquid plasma. You can find a list of symptoms,
      and which chemicals are required to get them, here: http://wiki.ss13.eu/index.php/Infections#Symptoms_Table'
  - tweak: The virologist starts with a bottle of plasma in his smart fridge.
  - tweak: Made it so you cannot accidentally click in the gaps between chem masters.

  Razharas:
  - tweak: Reworked how ling stings are done, now when you click a sting in the changeling
      tab it becomes current active sting, the icon of that sting appears under the
      chem counter, alt+clicking anyone will sting them with current sting, clicking
      the icon of the sting will unset it.
  - tweak: Monkeys have ling chem counter and active sting icons in their UI.
  - tweak: Going monkey -&gt; human will try to equip the human with everything on
      the ground below it.

  Rolan7:
  - tweak: Leather gloves can be used to removes lights.
  - rscadd: Plant, ore, and trash bags have a new option to pick up all items of single
      type
  - tweak: Creating astroturf now works like sandstone, converting all the grass at
      once.
  - tweak: Uranium and radium can be used instead of mutagen.  10 can mutate species,
      5 or 2 mutate traits.  Highly toxic.
  - experiment: Plants require a little light to live.  Mushroom require even less
      (2 units vs 4) and take less damage.

  Incoming:
  - rscadd: Magic Mania! Powerful new magical tools and skills for wizard and crew
      alike!
  - rscadd: Beware the new Summon Magic spell, which will grant the crew access to
      magical tools and spells and cause some to misuse it!
  - rscadd: 'One Time Spellbooks that can be spawned during summon magic that can
      teach a low level magic skill to <i>anyone</i>! Beware the effects of reading
      pre-owned books, the magical rights management is potent!

      '
  - rscadd: Magical Wands that can be spawned during Summon Magic! They come in a
      variety of effects that mimic both classical wizard spells and all new ones.
      They come precharged but lack the means to refill them once their magical energy
      is depleted... Fire efficently!
  - rscadd: Be aware of the new Charge spell, which can take normally useless spent
      wands and give them new life! This mysterious effect has been found to wear
      down the overall magical potency of wands over time however. Beyond wands the
      clever magical user can find ways to use this spell on other things that may
      benefit from a magical charge...
  - rscadd: The Staff of Resurrection, which holds intense healing magics able to
      defeat death itself! Look out for this invaluable magical tool during castings
      of Summon Magic.
  - rscadd: Be on the lookout for a new apprentice! This noble mage is a different
      beast from most wizards, trained in the arts of defending and healing. Too bad
      he still works for the wizard!
