  Erro:
  - tweak: Examining humans now works a bit differently. Some external suits and helmets
      can hide certain pieces of clothing so you don't see them when examining. Glasses
      are also now displayed when examining.
  - tweak: The job selection screen has been changed a little to hopefully make making
      changes there easier.

  - rscadd: 'The return of the Nanotrasen Scripting Language! (NTSL) If you haven''t
      heard of NTSL, it is a scripting language within a game for telecomms. Yes,
      you can create scripts to interact with the radio! For more information, head
      here: http://wiki.nanotrasen.com/index.php?title=NT_Script But before you do,
      if you are not an antag, do not create bad scripts which hinders communication.'
  - rscadd: Cameras, mulebots, APCs, radios and cyborgs can have signallers attached
      to their wires, like airlocks!
  - rscadd: Cameras have non-randomized wires and the power wire when pulsed will
      now toggle the camera on and off.
  - rscadd: Cyborgs have a new wire, the lockdown wire! It will disable/enable the
      lockdown of a Cyborg when pulsed.
  - rscadd: The traffic control computer (or more commonly known as the computer which
      lets you add NTSL scripts) will now have a user log, which will log all user
      activity. Other users can then view that log and see who has been uploading
      naughty scripts!
  - rscadd: NTSL has two new functions! time() and timestamp(format) will help you
      increase the range of types of scripts you can make, especially time(); since
      you can then make the scripts know the different between each execution by storing
      the results in memory.
  - rscadd: Two new advance disease symptoms! Their names are "Longevity" and "Anti-Bodies
      Metabolism". Have fun experimenting with them!

  - rscadd: Added Exosuit Jetpack

      I'll switch it to run on enriched) - requires research (level 3 in Materials,
      Power Manipulation and Engineering)
  - imageadd: Added Ripley construction steps sprites (courtesy of <b>WJohnston</b>

      embedded browser) for some reason.
2012-02-09:
  Erro:
  - tweak: Engineering and security lockers now spawn with their respective backpacks
      in them so job-changers can look as they should. HoS locker now also contains
      an armored vest, for the convenience of the HoS who wants to play with one.
  - tweak: Slightly changed the spawn order of items in the CE and HoS lockers to
      make starting up a hint less tedious.

      (though may still swap places with help intent)'

2012-02-12:
  Pete:
  - tweak: Updated fitness, athletic shorts are now available!
2012-02-13:
  Kor:
  - rscadd: A new item, the null rod, protects the one bearing it from cult magic.
      One starts in the chaplains office, and this replaces the job based immunity
      he had. The null rod also is capable of dispelling runes upon hitting them (the
      bible can no longer do this)
  - rscadd: Shooting fuel tanks with lasers or bullets now causes them to explode
  - rscadd: A construct shell is now waiting to be found in space.
  - tweak: Chaplains can no longer self heal with the bible

  Kor:
  - tweak: Terrorists Win! Desert Eagles and Riot Shields now spawn on the syndicate
      shuttle, replacing the c20r
  - tweak: The Detectives gun still uses .38, but they're now fully lethal bullets.
      Go ahead, make his day.
  - tweak: The Veil Render has been nerfed, the Nar-Sie it spawns will not pull anchored
      objects. This is a temporary measure, more nerfs/reworking to come
2012-02-16:
  Smoke Carter:
  - rscadd: Newscasters now alert people of new feeds and wanted-alerts simultaneously.
2012-02-18:
  Sieve:
  - bugfix: Stopped the unholy Radium/Uranium/Carbon smoke that crashed the server.
      And for anyone that did this, you are a horrible person
  - bugfix: Cleanbots clean dirt
  - tweak: Cleanbots automatically patrol on construction
  - rscdel: Removed silicate because it is not useful enough for how much lag it caused
2012-02-19:
  KorPhaeron:
  - imageadd: 'A new construct type: Artificer. It is capable of constructing defenses,
      repairing fellow constructs, and summoning raw materials to construct further
      constructs'
  - bugfix: Simple animals (constructs, Ian, etc) can now see their health in the

  - tweak: The Research Director's consoles were moved into the <b>completely empty</b>
      cage in the back of his office.
2012-02-24:
  PolymorphBlue:
  - rscadd: Headsets are now modular!  Use a screwdriver on them to pop out their
      encrpytion keys, and use a key on one to put it in.  A headset can hold two
      keys.  Normal headsets start with 1 key, department headsets with two.  The
      standard chip does nothing, and is not required for listening to the common
      radio.
  - bugfix: 'Binary translators made into a encrpytion key, and fixed.  They now broadcast
      to AIs properly.  '
2012-02-25:
  Doohl:
  - rscadd: Telecommunications has been refined, with many new features and modules
      implemented.
  - experiment: <b>NTSL (Nanotrasen Scripting Language) is ONLINE!</b> This is a brand
      new, fully operational scripting language embedded within SS13 itself. The intended
      purpose is to eventually expand this scripting language to Robotics and possibly
      other jobs, but for now you may play with the TCS (Traffic Control Systems)
      implementation of NTSL in the Telecommunications Satellite. Recommended you
      read the NT Script wiki page for information on how to use the language itself.
      Other than that, there's not a lot of documentation.
  - bugfix: Radio systems have been further optimized, bugfixed, etc. Should be more
      stable.
  - tweak: Intercoms now require power to work.
2012-02-26:
