  AnturK:
  - bugfix: normal toolboxes can't hold fishing rods anymore
  Capybara Holly:
  - refactor: Datum AI can now switch to different movement datums in their behavior.
  - refactor: Allows datum AI to create new plans while a plan is still executing
  Capybara holly:
  - bugfix: After rigorous training excercises monkeys now understand how to defend
      themselves from vile greytiders again
  Fikou, sprites from Halcyon, some old code from Basilman and Armhulen.:
  - refactor: Honorbound and Burdened mutations are brain traumas now.
  - rscadd: Psykers. Become a psyker through the path of the burdened, or a genetic
      breakdown.
  - rscadd: Echolocation Component.
  GoldenAlpharex:
  - refactor: Went through and refactored a lot of the old code of the biogenerator,
      and made multiple improvements to its logic, which should hopefully make it
      behave more consistently. Nearly all of it is now also fully documented, so
      as to make it easier for anyone else that has to sift through it in the future.
  - qol: The biogenerator now processes items five times faster, up to 20 times faster
      if properly upgraded!
  - qol: The biogenerator is no longer capped on biomass. Its visuals will change
      up until 5000 biomass, but you're free to go as high as you'd like with it!
      Sky's the limit!
  - bugfix: Fixed the logic of the biogenerator that would make it so the amount of
      biomass used for recipes was wildly inconsistent. Now, there's no more back-end
      rounding up, it's all on the front end when it needs to be, so there's no loss
      or gain of biomass when there shouldn't be.
  - spellcheck: Fixed a capitalization issue with the seaweed sheets in the biogenerator
      recipes.
  - spellcheck: Fixed multiple inconsistencies between the messages sent to your chat
      by the biogenerator.

      actually know what this thing does
  NamelessFairy:
  - rscadd: You can now reinforce plating to protect your department from the troublemakers
      upstairs. Station builders might find these useful to put the stations most
      secure locations on the lower floors.
  - imageadd: added sprites for reinforced plating
  - code_imp: RCD proofing has been variablized and can now be applied to any floor
      type instead of just reinforced floors.
  - bugfix: Rather than having two surgery B's on icebox you get a Surgery North and
      a Surgery South
  Pickle-Coding:
  - bugfix: Fix unnecessary mole scaling with gas turbine gas thermal energy loss
      from work done.
  - bugfix: The gas turbine no longer creates power from thermal energy it can't take.
  Sealed101:
  - rscadd: robotics now has access to a mech camera add-on, which installs a security
      camera into the mech. bodycam footage from the big leagues!
  - qol: cyborg cameras should be more active with updating static when moving (ideally
      down from 2.5 seconds to 0.5 between updates), make sure to report any jank
      if you happen on some
  ShizCalev:
  - bugfix: Full mugs no longer appear empty in the map editor.

      they combine!
  - rscadd: Try not to turn yourself into a fly, OK?
