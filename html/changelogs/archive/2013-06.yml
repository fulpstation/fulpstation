  - tweak: To reduce costs of security equipment, mounted flashers have been adjusted
      to use common handheld flashes as their flashbulbs. Although these flashbulbs
      are more prone to burnout, they can easily be replaced with wirecutters.

  - tweak: Headsets can no longer broadcast into a channel that is disabled.<br/>Headsets
      now have a button to turn off the power instead of the speaker. This button

      for about 20 seconds.

  - tweak: Updated chemical grenades. The build process is much the same, except they
      require an igniter-X assembly instead of a single assembly item. You can also
      just use a cable coil to get regular grenade behaviour.

  - rscadd: Job preferences menu now not only allows you to left-click the level (i.e.
      [Medium]) to raise it, but also to right-click it to lower it. That means you
      don't have to cycle through all the levels to get rid of a [Low].

  - rscadd: Nanotrasen R&amp;D released a new firmware patch for their station AIs.
      Included among the changes is the new ability for AIs to interact with fire
      doors. R&amp;D officials state they feel giving station AIs more influence could
      only lead to good things.
