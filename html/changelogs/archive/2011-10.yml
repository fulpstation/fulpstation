  - unknown: Pandemic recharge speed is affected by the number of different types
      of antibodies in the blood sample. For maximum efficiency, use blood samples
      with only a single type of antibody. (Blood samples with two types of antibodies
      will still let the Pandemic recharge slightly faster than it used to.)

      protocols'. For combat exosuits it's disabled by default. While in maintenance
      mode, exosuit can't move or use equipment.

  - unknown: ' White Cane Safety Day:'
  Agouri:
  - unknown: There has been a tidal wave of bugfixes over the last 5 or so days. If
      you had previously tried something on the station, saw that it was bugged and
      never tried it again, chances are it got fixed. I don't want you to neglect
      using stuff because you think it was bugged, which it was at one point, but
      no longer is. Thanks, happy new semester to everyone~
  Doohl:

  Errorage:

  - unknown: New WIP TK system added.  To activate your TK click the throw button
      with an empty hand.  This will bring up a tkgrab item.  Click on a non-anchored
      (currently) non mob Object to select it as your "focus".  Once a focus is selected
      so long as you are in range of the focus you can now click somewhere to throw
      the focus at the target.  To quit using TK just drop the tkgrab item.

  - unknown: 'Stunglove overhaul: part one. Stun gloves are now made by wiring a pair
      of gloves, and then attaching a battery- this shows up on the object sprite,
      but not on your character. Stungloves use 2500 charge per stun! This means that
      some low capacity batteries will make <i>useless</i> stungloves. To get your
      old inconspicous gloves back, simply cut away the wire and battery. <font color="red">Note
      that insulated gloves lose their insulation when you wire them up!</font> <b>Yet

  - unknown: "<font color=\"red\">Removed sleepypens!</font> Paralysis pens have been\
      \ changed to look like normal pens instead of penlights, and have been slightly\
