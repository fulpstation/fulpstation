  tralezab code, Drag for the commission and player project, cre#0484 for their spritework:
  - rscadd: Divine Archer Armor and Weapon
  - qol: Bows give more feedback when you're doing something wrong, like trying to
      draw without a nocked arrow
  - code_imp: Sorted files, cleaned bow code up to allow subtypes
  vinylspiders:
  - bugfix: the anomaly refinery will no longer let you insert cores of insufficient
      quality to refine
