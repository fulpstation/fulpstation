  Ed640:
  - bugfix: Paper bins after being stacked too high to fall over or getting burnt
      will no longer void your "important" paper forms when trying to add more paper
      afterwards.
  Melbert:
  - refactor: Cow tipping and medibot tipping is now a component.
  Ryll/Shaps:
  - qol: Admin ghosts can now use the :j speech prefix to relay messages from deadchat
      to their current linked body, if one exists. Perfect for keeping in touch with
      your deployed ERT via headset without needing to stay in your body back at Centcom!
  Watermelon914:
  - expansion: Adds the multiplexer circuit component.
  - expansion: Changed the drone circuit to have a lower movement delay.
  - qol: Circuit components can now be directly inserted into shells.
  - qol: Added the description and special details to each circuit component that
      can be accessed when it is inside an integrated circuit. These will have specific
      details, such as power usage, distance effectiveness and more.
  YakumoChen:
  - bugfix: Dynamic will no longer create malf humans for players for never play silicon
      in the first place.

  Cheshify:
  - balance: The Forcefield Projector takes a second to put a forcefield down.
  RandomGamer123:

      on modular computers to request to order things remotely.
  SpaceVampire:
  - bugfix: The spare Codex Cicatrix created by the ritual, no longer comes with free
      charges.
  Timberpoes:
  - qol: Right clicking containers such as backpacks with certain items may now perform
      that item's action instead of opening the backpack. The behaviour has been implemented
      with the forensic scanner, which can now scan objects it was previously unable
      to in melee range, such as backpacks, by right clicking. Any items you'd want
      to use againt backpacks without inserting the item or opening the backpack should
      be reported as issues so they can be implemented.
  Watermelon914:
  - expansion: Adds the MMI circuit component.
  - qol: Allows inputting signals into signal ports.
  - expansion: Adds the airlock shell. The circuit has full control over the airlock.
  - expansion: Implements USB cables for the binary valve to be able to open/close
      the valve.
  - expansion: Adds a private channel for radios that only lets circuits with the
      same owner's ID to interact with it.
  - refactor: Refactors USB code to be easier to use for less experienced coders.
  eeSPee:
  - bugfix: Fixed heretic ghouls having reduced max health after being revived after
      deghouled
  - qol: heretic ghouls now have a little moodlet tooltip
2021-06-26:
  Arkatos:
  - qol: Improved radial info messages for some spider variants to better reflect
      their strengths and weaknesses.
  - bugfix: Spider egg clusters now stop processing when they mature to improve performance.
  - refactor: Spider egg clusters were integrated into the mob spawner system. This
      means you will now see grown spider eggs in the ghost spawners interface.
  - admin: Alien-banned players are no longer allowed to spawn from the spider egg
      clusters.
  Sheits:
  - bugfix: Made android and skeleton wings work instead of telling the user "you
      feel nothing but a terrible aftertaste" when they drink strange elixir
  - bugfix: Made android and skeleton wings not use a mutant colour overlay like lizard
      wings
  - imageadd: Fly wings :)
  - code_imp: Added android species check
  TemporalOroboros:
  - rscadd: Cigarettes heat their contents while they are lit.
  - balance: Candy cigarettes now caramelize their own sugar. Their temperature has
      been reduced to ensure they don't charcoalize it too.
  - code_imp: Cleaned up cigarette code a bit.
  Timberpoes:
  - balance: Agent ID cards can now steal accesses wirelessly from other players by
      right click slapping them with the agent ID card. This operation is completely
      covert, minus the fact you have to hold your ID card in your hand to initiate
      it.
  - balance: Agent ID cards can now steal accesses wirelessly from ID cards in containers
      including bags, wallets, tablets and PDAs without having to open them or remove
      ID cards first by right clicking. You can still open containers to steal accesses
      from exact cards as before.
  carshalash:
  - bugfix: fixed inaccurate foodtypes/taste tags

  Fikou:
  - bugfix: fixes not being able to upload mutations from disk to dna console

  - bugfix: Fixes passive vents on space tiles flooding space with whatever was being
      vented
  SpaceDragon00:
  - bugfix: 'Reverted the normal blob''s max HP and initial HP values, which were
      accidentally modified (Old: 30 and 30, New: 25 and 21)'
  - bugfix: Fixed an issue where certain strains with bonus core regeneration were
      regenerating faster than intended
  - code_imp: Used a few unimplemented defines from the PR, like for the Strong and
      Resource blobs
  - code_imp: Added an initial HP define that is set as a normal blob's integrity
      upon Initialize
  Timberpoes:
  - rscadd: Baseball bats can now be used to break kneecaps with their right click
      attack. This requires the target to be one of either prone, immobilised or buckled
      to something. If you aim for the legs and right click, you'll wind up a swing
      for the kneecaps. Research indicates that this isn't good for the target's legs.
  - bugfix: Fixes an issue where right clicking on an ID-secured locker would unintentionally
      trigger twice, locking then unlocking the locker. Right clicking now correctly
      attempts to lock and unlock a locker only once.

  Coconutwarrior97:
  - rscadd: Added funtionality so free golems get an alert from policy.json.
  - rscdel: Deleted a line of text for Free golem's flavor text. Since in my opinion
      the spawn-in text, with the addition of the policy.json text was a bit too much.
  MrStonedOne:
  - server: Added configs to disable laggy hard deletes once they lag the server too
      much.
  - admin: laggy hard deletes only output once per type path.
  Time-Green:
  - refactor: hunger mechanics are now inherent to stomaches
  - expansion: ethereal charge mechanic is now unique to their stomache and can be
      transferred freely
  dragomagol:
  - imagedel: removes the yellow siding tiles at Centcom
  ninjanomnom & Trina (Sprites):
  - rscadd: Stationary tanks can now be constructed using most materials. Start the
      frame with a stack of plasteel.
  - balance: Stationary tanks are no longer bigger on the inside than the outside.
  - rscadd: Stationary tanks now merge together when adjacent so you can make large
      gas storage structures.
  - balance: Stationary tanks share behavior with canisters and can over-pressurize
      and explode in the same fashion.
2021-06-29:
  Arokha:
  - bugfix: async modal message/title swapped
  - bugfix: async modal not firing callbacks
  RandomGamer123 and IndieanaJones:
  - qol: Offering a cyborg on a cult rune now allows the cultist to transform the
      cyborg into a construct of their choosing.
  - bugfix: Offering a cyborg on a cult offer rune no longer creates an empty soulstone
      and round removes the cyborg.
  Ryll/Shaps:
  - balance: Knives (such as the kitchen knife, hunting knife, combat knife, etc...)
      are generally more effective at causing slashing wounds now. The butcher's cleaver
      in particular is now equal to a circular saw in terms of wounding.
  - balance: Scalpels are an eensy bit less effective at wounding enemies wearing
      armor, though they are still very effective at causing bleeding.
  Sheits:
  - balance: Reduces the maximum weight paradox bags can hold
  - imageadd: Adds paradox bag icon and belt sprites

      flavour text, if any such policy exists in config.
  cacogen:
  - balance: Cannabis has more believable effects
  zxaber:
  - bugfix: RD consoles now have hardware supporting ID changes by default.
  - balance: Jaunting spells of all types (except for Nightmare) no longer allow for
      the user to end up inside a wall or most other dense objects. Instead, you will
      be moved to a valid spot on the path you took, or returned to your start location.
2021-06-30:
  Fikou:

  Watermelon914:

  - expansion: Adds the table datatype that can have queries performed on it with
      components.
  - expansion: Adds USB connections for the arrest console.
  - bugfix: Fixed race conditions happening with circuits.
