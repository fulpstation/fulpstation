  Razharas:
  - rscadd: Constructable machines now depend on R&amp;D; parts!
  - rscadd: 'DNA scanner: Laser quality lessens irradiation. Manipulator quality drastically
      improves precision (9x for best part) and scanner quality allows you to scan
      suicides/ling husks, with the best part enabling the cloner''s autoprocess button,
      making it scan people in the scanner automatically.'
  - rscadd: 'Clone pod: Manipulator quality improves the speed of cloning. Scanning
      module quality affects with how much health people will be ejected, will they
      get negative mutation/no mutations/clean of all mutations/random good mutation,
      at best quality will enable clone console''s autoprocess button and will try
      to clone all the dead people in records automatically, together with best DNA
      scanner parts cloning console will be able to work in full automatic regime
      autoscanning people and autocloning them.'
  - rscadd: 'Borg recharger: Capacitors'' quality and powercell max charge affect
      the speed at which borgs recharge. Manipulator quality allows borg to be slowly
      repaired while inside the recharges, best manipulator allows even fire damage
      to be slowly repaired.'
  - rscadd: 'Portable power generators: Capacitors'' quality produce more power. Better
      lasers consume less fuel and reduce heat production PACMAN with best parts can
      keep whole station powered with about sheet of plamsa per minute (approximately,
      wasn''t potent enough to test).'
  - rscadd: 'Autolathe: Better manipulator reduces the production time and lowers
      the cost of things(they will also have less m_amt and g_amt to prevent production
      of infinity metal), stacks'' cant be reduced in cost, because thatll make production
      of infinity metal/glass easy'
  - rscadd: 'Protolathe: Manipulators quality affects the cost of things(they will
      also have less m_amt and g_amt to prevent production of infinity metal), best
      manipulators reduces the cost 5 times (!)'
  - rscadd: 'Circuit imprinter: Manipulator quality affects the cost, best manipulator
      reduce cost(acid insluded) 4 times, i.e. 20 boards per 100 units of acid'
  - rscadd: 'Destructive analyzer: Better parts allow items with less reliability
      in. Redone how reliability is handled, you now see item reliability in the deconstruction
      menu and deconstructing items that has same or one point less research type
      level will rise the reliability of all known designs that has one or more research
      type requirements as the deconstructed item. Designs of the same type raise
      in reliability more. Critically broken things rise reliability of the design
      drastically. Whole reliability system is not used a lot but now at least on
      the R&amp;D; part it finally matters.'

  - rscadd: Added Syndicate Cyborgs.
  - rscadd: They can be ordered for 25 telecrystals by Nuclear Operatives. A ghost
      / observer with "Be Operative" ticked in their game options will be chosen to
      control it.
  - rscadd: 'Their loadout is: Crowbar, Flash, Emag, Esword, Ebow, Laser Rifle. Each
      weapon costs 100 charge to fire, except the Esword, which has a 500 charge hitcost.
      Each borg is equipped with a 25k cell by default.'
  - rscadd: Syndicate borgs can hear the binary channel, but they won't show up on
      the Robotics Control computer or be visible to the AI. Their lawset is the standard
      emag one.
  - rscadd: Added two cyborg recharging stations to the Syndicate Shuttle.
2014-01-14:
  SirBayer:
  - experiment: Armor now reduces damage by the protection percentage, instead of
      randomly deciding to half or full block damage by those percentages.
  - rscadd: Shotguns, with buckshot shells, will fire a spread of pellets at your
      target, like a real shotgun blast.

  ManeaterMildred:
  - tweak: Changed the way the Gygax worked. It now has less defense and shot deflection,
      but is faster and have less battery drain per step.
  - tweak: Nerfed the Carbine's brute damage and renamed it to FNX-99 "Hades" Carbine.
  - tweak: "Nerfed the Gygax defense from 300 to 250.<br/>\n\t\t\t\t  Nerfed the Gygax\

  Ergovisavi:
  - rscadd: Gibtonite, the explosive ore, can now be found on the asteroid. It's very
      hard to tell between it and diamonds, at first glance.
  - rscadd: Gibtonite deposits will blow up after a countdown when you attempt to
      mine it, but you can stop it with an analyzer at any time. It makes for a good
      mining explosive.
  - rscadd: The closer you were to the explosion when you analyze the Gibtonite deposit,
      the better the Gibtonite you can get from it.
  - rscadd: Once extracted, it must be struck with a pickaxe or drill to activate
      it, where it will go through its countdown again to explode!
  - tweak: Explosives will no longer destroy the ore inside of asteroid walls or lying
      on the floor.
