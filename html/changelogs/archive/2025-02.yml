      effects when they come into contact with mobs or objects. This can be via several
      means, ingestion, touch, or vapors. The more radioactive the reagent, the more
      likely it is to irradiate. Polonium is the most radioactive with a x3 multiplier,
      radium is next with a x2 multiplier, and uranium is the weakest with just a
      x1 multiplier.
  - balance: Polonium no longer guarantees instant irradiation when the reagent is
      inside a mob.
