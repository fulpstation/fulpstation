  - rscadd: Nanotrasen has re-arranged the station blueprint designs to have non-essential
      APCs moved to the maintenance hallways. Non-essential rooms that aren't connected
      to a maintenance hallway will have their APC remain. Station Engineers will
      now have easy access to a room's APC without needing access themselves. Nanotrasen
      also wishes to remind you that you should not sabotage these easy to access
      APCs to cause distractions or to lockdown someone in a location. Thank you for
      reading.

  - rscadd: Nanotrasen has recentely had to change its provider of alcoholic beverages
      to a provider of lower quality. Cases of the old ailment known as alcohol poisoning
      have returned. Bar goers are to be weary of this new condition.

  - bugfix: NTSL no longer allows you to use a function within another function parameter.
      This was changed to help prevent server crashes; if your working script no longer
      compiles this is why.

  - wip: 'Cargo Overhaul: Phase 1'
  - rscadd: Ported Bay's cargo computer categoy system
  - tweak: Crates have been tweaked significantly. Crates have been reduced to single
      item types where possible, namely with expensive crates such as weapons and
      armor. A total of 28 new crates have been added, including chemical and tracking
      implants, and raw materials can also be bought from cargo for a significant
      number of points (subject to change)
  - bugfix: This was a pretty large edit of repetitive data, so no doubt I've made
      a mistake or two. Please report any bugs to the usual place

  - tweak: Changed the blob balance to make the blob start strong but grow slower,
      resulting in rounds where the blob doesn't instantly get killed off if found
      out and doesn't immediately dominate after being left alone long enough. AIs
      no longer have to quarantine the station.

  - rscadd: Malf AIs now have a new power which will spawn a "borging machine". This
      machine will turn living humans into loyal cyborgs which the AI can use to take
      over the station with. The AI will limit themselves by using this ability, such
      as no shunting, and the machine will have a long cooldown usage.

      logs and detective scanner reports
  - rscadd: Added date to PDA

  - rscadd: Replaced the EMP grenades from the uplink with an EMP kit. The kit contains
      a grenade, an implant and a flashlight with 5 uses that can EMP any object or
      mob in melee range.

      Be careful, they''re one of the hottest foods in the galaxy!'
