  - expansion: Spider nurses and broodmothers can now place down sealed webs by webbing

      major change is that broodmothers now take 15 seconds to lay eggs as opposed
      to 10 seconds.
  - qol: Spiders can see further in the dark now.
  Y0SH1M4S73R:

  esainane:
  - bugfix: Smart pipes now calculate their direction properly, and construction code
      checks direction logic properly. This fixes many problems with atmospherics
      construction.
  - bugfix: Smart pipe construction now no longer tries to work around irrelevant
      pipes which are on completely different layers and do not interact with the
      new pipe in any way.
  - bugfix: Smart pipes with less than two allowed directions can no longer be built.
      The pipe would be invisible, but still interact in weird ways.
  - bugfix: One tile can no longer have more than one atmospheric component ready
      to connect in the same direction and layer. This prevents the scenario where
      a temperature pump is placed in a manner which looks like it's going to connect
      to a horizontal bridge pipe, but actually turns the vertical plasma input pipe
      behind it into a manifold, ruptures the connected plasma canister, and sets
      Toxins on fire.
  - qol: Smart pipes are now much, much smarter. During construction, if a smart pipe
      would block placement of a component, it will see if permitted connectivity
      can be reconfigured to make room for other components. This includes negotiation
      with other smart pipes, preferring to create pipe crossings where available,
      or create an opposing corner pipe if not. The RPD can now also reconfigure allowed
      connectivity for existing smart pipes manually. Smart pipes can never be reconfigured
      to have less than two allowed directions, and active connections cannot be reconfigured.
      Automatic reconfiguration will never cause a smart pipe to permit connectivity
      that was not previously permitted.
  - bugfix: Multi-layer pipe components can trigger smart pipe negotiation where relevant.
  - refactor: Rearranged some atmospherics pipe code. Fewer redundant loops, add and
      use documented and centralized helpers for bit manipulation where sensible.
      Make bitfield assumptions explicit.
  - code_imp: made a small part of the documentation in the area less wrong dear god
      my eyes the goggles do nothing
  tralezab:
  - spellcheck: Changed the wording on antag panel policy a little bit.
2021-08-31:

  Y0SH1M4S73R:
  - bugfix: Traitors that are unable to receive equipment required for specific objectives
      will be able to order that equipment from the uplink. Other antagonists that
      are unable to receive such equipment can call in a pod containing that equipment,
      unless they somehow have an unlocked uplink on their person, in which case they
      can order it from the uplink.
