  Giacom:
  - rscadd: Bottles can now be broken over people's heads! To do this, you must have
      the harm intent on and you must be targeting the person's head. This change
      affects alcoholic bottles only. It does not change pill bottles or chemistry
      bottles. Helmets help protect you from damage and the regents of the bottles
      will splash over the victim.
  - rscadd: 'AI''s now have access to a PDA. Note: It is not PDA-bomb-able'
  - rscadd: Health analyzers and medical PDAs now give a time of death when used on

  - rscadd: pAI gets a better PDA that can actually receive messages from people.
      They can also instantly reply like everybody else now and they can toggle their
      receiver/signaller/ringer.
  - rscadd: You can show the AI the notes on your PDA by holding it up to a camera.
      When you show up a paper/pda to the camera the AI can now click on your name
      to go to you, if you're near a camera. People who are Unknown will not have
      a link; which would've allowed the AI to track them.
  - rscadd: Made the" common server" and the "preset right receiver" listen for frequencies
      144.1 to 148.9. This will allow people to use different frequencies to talk
      to eachother without bothering the common channel. It will also allow Revs and
      Cultists to work with each other; everything is still logged though so it still
      has risks.
  - rscadd: Increased the maximum frequency limit for handheld radios and intercoms.
      It will give you the option to just use station bounced radios on a higher frequency
      so that anyone with a headset can't simply tune in.
  - rscadd: Created an All-In-One Grinder that is suppose to replace the blender,
      juicer and reagent grinder all together. Meaning any department that has a juicer,
      blender and grinder will instead get this. It will help people be more independent
      from Chemistry by recycling foods and plants.

  - rscadd: Added Russian Revolvers. This is a special Revolver that can only hold
      a single bullet randomly in it's chamber. This will allow you to play Russian
      Roulette with your fellow crew members! You can use it like a normal gun but
      you will need to cycle through the chamber slots until you hit the bullet. Only
      admin spawnable.
  Willox and Messycakes:
  - rscadd: pAI Emoticons! Allows each pAI to set their screen to display an array
      of faces! Click on 'Screen Display' in the pAI OS for a list.

  - tweak: Added a new wire for Cyborgs. See if you can figure out what it does.
  - tweak: You can now fill any container with a sink. You can change the amount to
      fill, from sinks, by setting your container's transfer amount.

  Giacom:
  - rscadd: Added the Light Replacer. This is a device that can auto replace lights
      that are broken, missing or burnt. Currently it is found in the Janitor's closet
      and Janitor Borgs can equip it. You can refill it with glass, or if you're a
      Cyborg, just recharge. It is emaggable and will replace lights with rigged lights.
      The light's explosion was nerfed to help balance it and it is very noticable
      when you are holding an emagged Light Replacer.
  - tweak: The Janitor's equipment locator, on their PDA, will now tell you the direction
      of the equipment.
2012-07-22:

  - tweak: You can now make newlines with your PDA notes.
  - tweak: You can now research and build the Light Replacer.
  - tweak: You can now store donuts in the donut box. The next donut you pull out
      will be the last one you put in.
  - tweak: APCs will auto-turn on if there is enough power in the grid, even if the
      powercell is below 30%. The APC needs to be charged for a long enough time before
      it starts turning equipment on, to avoid spazzing out. If you have any problems
      with it, such as equipment turning off and on repeatedly then please make an
      issue report with a screenshot of the APC.

  Errorage:
  - tweak: Both the chef and bartender have access to the bar area so both can serve
      if the other is incompetent or does not exist. Bartender's shotgun and shaker
      were moved to his back room and the booze-o-mat is now ID restricted to the
      bartender.
  - rscadd: Added powercells into vending machines in engineering
  - rscadd: Gave two beartraps to the janitor for pest control purposes................

  Errorage:
  - rscadd: You can now use crayons to color eggs
  - rscadd: Mice have invaded the station!
  Giacom:
  - rscadd: All radios now only work in their Z level. This means that the CommSat
      has a few more additions to work with this change. There is now a new Telecomms
      Machine called the Relay which allows information to travel across Z levels.
      It it then linked to a new machine called the Hub, which will receive information
      from the Relays and send it to the buses. Because every Z level needs these
      relays, which are linked up with Receivers/Broadcasters, every Z level will
      get one. There is one in the station, in the RD's office, one in Telecomms as
      always, one in the Ruskie station which is turned off and hidden from the HUB's
      linked list. The last one is in Mining but the location for it has not been
      decided yet.
  - tweak: PDAs now need to be in a Z level with a functioning Relay/Comms Network
      in order to send messages. It will also send uncompressed (scrambled) messages
      like you would with the ordinary voice messages.
  - imageadd: 'Added some of WJohnston''s sprites. Added a new mining borg sprite,
      Added a new high tech security airlock, Added the new telecomm sprites for Relays.
      Hubs were given old Bus sprites. '

  Giacom:
  - tweak: Removed passive throwing. You need at least an aggressive hold of the mob
      before you can throw them.
  - rscadd: 'New map changes by Ikarrus. AI Upload Foyer is now Secure Tech Access,
      and the outer door only requires Bridge access. Attached to it are two new rooms:
      The messaging server room and the communications relay. The comms relay room
      runs off its own SMES unit like the AI, so it won''t be affected by powersinks'
