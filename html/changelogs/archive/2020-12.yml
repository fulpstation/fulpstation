  Azarak:
  - tweak: Rotting gibs no longer make miasma on planetary turfs, to save on processing
      as it quickly dissipiates into planetary atmos anyway. They'll also stop rotting
      after some time
  Ghommie:
  - bugfix: The ashdrake won't become enraged if all lava arena targets have gone
      clientless or deleted now.

  Timberpoes:
  - admin: Admins may now call the deadchat_plays proc on any movable atom in the
      game, allowing deadchat to move it around with zero effort. They should now
      call the generic deadchat_plays instead of deadchat_plays_goose to turn Birdboat
      into a deadchat controlled vomit goose.
  - admin: The VV dropdown now contains an option to enable or disable deadchat control.
      This comes with an alert confirmation box to allow you to back out and chat
      messages to tell you the result.
  - refactor: There's now a lot more feedback when deadchat is controlling something,
      including telling you when command inputs are successful, telling you the remaining
      cooldown until you can input new commands when it fails and additional examine
      text detailling the control mode, commands and overall cooldown.
  Tlaltecuhtli:
  - bugfix: sausage is crafted with raw meat instead of cooked meat
  necromanceranne:
  - balance: Uranium golems now no longer irradiate things around them passively.
  - balance: Uranium golems now irradiate targets they punch, while also doing burn
      damage with punches. They only hit as hard a human, however.
  - balance: Uranium golems are significantly resistant to brute, but less resistant
      to all other damage types compared to typical golems.
  - balance: Uranium golems release their radiation pulse when hit by attacks. Or
      objects.
  - rscadd: Uranium golems can now wear engineering jumpsuits, work boots and wintercoats.

      from headpats and grabs.'
  - bugfix: blind people can now feel headpats
  Nari Harimoto:
  - bugfix: Kilo Station white ship shuttle dock no longer spawns a redundant mining
      shuttle

      has access, obviously)
  Timberpoes:
  - bugfix: You are no longer able to teleport rigged power cells across the station
      to remotely detonate departments using the BRPED. Rigged cells will instead
      explode inside the BRPED when you attempt to transfer them. That's right, you
      can now rig BRPEDs to explode when people use them.
  coiax:
  - tweak: The "eye of god" only becomes unremovable when put in your eye.
  - rscadd: You may now pick Implant as a preferred uplink location, meaning that
      if you become a traitor, you will start with an uplink implant. The cost of
      the implant (4 TC) is deducted from your total starting TC, because the Syndicate
      doesn't give freebies.
  - bugfix: Admins removing an uplink from a person with an uplink implant will now
      destroy the implant, rather than leaving an implant that does nothing.
