  - rscadd: Nanotrasen programmers have discovered a potential exploit involving a
      station's door control networks. With sufficient computing power, the network
      can be overloaded and forced to open or bolt closed every airlock at once.
  - experiment: Some reports suggest that the latest firmware update to Artifical
      Intelligence units installed in our research stations may contain this exploit.
      Any such reports that state that should a station's AI unit "malfunction", it
      may gain the ability to use this exploit to initate a full lockdown of the station.
      Fire locks and blast doors are also said to be affected.
  - rscadd: Nanotrasen officially holds no validity to these reports. We recommend
      that station personnel disregard such rumors.

  - bugfix: Having the nuke disk will no longer prevent you from using teleporters
      or crossing Z-levels. Leaving the Z-level however, will cause you to "suddenly
      lose" the disk.
  - rscadd: Pulled objects will now transition with you when as you transition Z-levels
      in space.
  Malkevin:
  - rscdel: IEDs have been removed
  - rscadd: Firebombs have been added
  - experiment: They're as reliable and predictable as you would expect from a soda
      can filled with flammable liquid and set off with an igniter contected to two
      wires. Use your branes and take proper precautions or leave a charred corpse,
      your choice.

  - tweak: 'NT Baton Refurbishment Team Notice: ''Released'' option in security records
      has been renamed ''Discharged'', and the sechud icon has been changed from a
      blue R to a blue D. Stop beating your released prisoners, dummies; they''re
      not revheads.'
  - tweak: 'NT Entertainment Department Notice: The prize-dispensing mechanism in
      Arcade machines has been replaced with a cheaper gas-powered motor. It should
      still be completely safe, unless an electromagnetic field disrupts it!'
  - tweak: 'Pill code tweaked. In short, you can feed monkeys pills now #whoa'
  - rscadd: 'Casings ejected from guns will now spin #wow'

  Ikarrus:
  - tweak: The 'Enter Exosuit' button was removed, and you have to click + drag yourself
      to enter a mech now; like you would to enter a disposal unit.
