2014-10-01:
  Cheridan:
  - rscadd: Experienced smugglers have joined the Syndicate, adding their bag of tricks
      to its arsenal. These tricky pouches can even fit under floor plating!
  Ikarrus:
  - wip: Adds Gang War, a new game mode still in alpha development.
  Incoming5643:
  - tweak: After a public relations nightmare in which a horde of 30 assistants violently
      dismembered a sole commander the revolution has begin tactically reducing their
      initial presence in stations with weak command structures. Should stations add
      to their command staff during the shift additional support will be provided.
  - tweak: Too many instances of crying CMOs hiding in the lockers of supposedly secured
      revoulutionary stations has lead to a crackdown on revolutionary policy. You
      must kill or maroon the entire command staff, reguardless of when they reached
      the station.
  - rscadd: Intense study into the underlying structure of the universe has revealed
      that everything fits into a massive SPACECUBE. This deep and profound understanding
      has led to a revolution in cross surface movement, and spacemen can look forward
      to a new era of predictable and safe space-fairing.
  Jordie0608:
  - tweak: Grille damage update, humans now deal less unarmed damage to grilles while
      projectiles and items deal more.
  - tweak: Replaced all AI turrets with porta-turrets that work on LoS instead of
      area and can be individually configured
  Miauw:
  - bugfix: Voice changer masks work again.
  - tweak: You can now turn voice changer masks on/off by activating them in your
      hand. They start off.
  - experiment: The amount of TC has been increased to 20, but the price of all items
      has been doubled as well
  - experiment: With this, the prices of stealthy items has been slightly decreased
      and the prices of offensive items slightly increased (+/- 1 TC)
  RemieRichards, JJRcop:
  - rscadd: New research in the area of robotics has been published on Maintenance
      Drones, little robots capable of repairing and improving the station. Unfortunately,
      all of the research was lost in a catastrophic server fire, but we know they
      can be made, so it's up to <b><i>you</i></b> to re-discover them! Make us proud!
  phil235:
  - experiment: Changed all clone damage descriptions to use the term cellular damage
      to avoid confusion with genetics mutations.
2014-10-05:
  Ikarrus:
  - bugfix: Character Save Files will now remember Species.
  Miauw:
  - soundadd: Added 5 new maintenance ambience tracks, made by Cuboos.
  Nobalm:
  - rscadd: Added examine descriptions to twenty eight objects.
  Paprika:
  - experiment: Due to some payroll cuts affecting lower-rank crewmembers on Space
      Station 13, we fear that uprisings and mutinies might be approaching. To help
      defend themselves, all heads of staff have been given telescopic batons to subdue
      attackers should they be assaulted during their shifts.
  - bugfix: Toolbelts can now hold pocket fire extinguishers. Atmos technicians spawn
      with them.
  - rscadd: Remember those magboots we had our undercover agents steal? Well we've
      finally reverse engineered them. Not only that, but we gave them a killer paintjob.
      They will be available in the uplinks of boarding parties we send out to Nanoscum
      stations.
  - rscadd: Listen up, Marauders! The Syndicate has recently cut back funding into
      boarding parties. What this means is no more hi-tech fancy energy guns. We've
      had to roll back to using cheaper, mass-produced automatic shotguns. But in
      retrospect, could this possibly be a downgrade?
2014-10-08:
  Cheridan:
  - tweak: Flash mechanics changed. Instead of a knockdown effect, it will cause a
      stumbling effect. This includes area-flashing. The five-use-per-minute limit
      has been removed. "Synthetic" flashes made in the protolathe are now normal
      flashes.
  Paprika:
  - rscadd: Added a unique shield to the Head of Security's locker. It can be concealed
      for storage and activated like an energy shield, but functions like a riot shield.
      It can also be made at the protolathe.
  - rscadd: 'Marauders: Due to your extremely great performance as of late, we''ve
      added a new equipment room on Mother Base. A lot of your equipment has been
      moved to this room, as well as some new equipment added onto the Mothership.
      Take some extra time to familiarize yourself with the placement of your equipment.'
  - rscadd: Oh, and you guys have a space carp now too.
  Paprka:
  - rscadd: Added jumpsuit adjusting. Adjust your jumpsuit to wear it more casually
      by rolling it down or roll up those sleeves of that hard-worn suit!
  - rscadd: Added a grey alternative to the detective's suit and trenchcoat. Now you
      can be a noir private investigator!
  Tkdrg:
  - rscadd: Space Station 13 has been deployed with transit tube dispensers. Central
      Command encourages the engineering department to repair and improve the station
      using this equipment.
2014-10-09:
  Paprika:
  - rscadd: Added inaprovaline MediPens (autoinjectors) that replace inaprovaline
      syringes in medkits. Like the syringes, these can be used to stabilize patients
      in critical condition, but require no medical knowledge to use.
  - experiment: Reverted the mining scanner to a manual scanner.
  - bugfix: Buffed the rate of the automatic scanner
  - rscadd: Added automatic scanner to equipment locker. It is also available by redeeming
      your voucher.
  - bugfix: Reduced the size of the mining jetpack, it now fits in backpacks. The
      capacity of the jetpack has been reduced as well, however.
  - experiment: Removed resonator from the mining voucher redemption. Replaced it
      with a mining drill.
2014-10-19:
  Donkie:
  - rscadd: Major atmos update. Featuring pretty colors.
  - rscadd: 4-Way pipes added.
  - rscadd: Flip-able trinary devices (mixer &amp; filter).
  - rscadd: Pipe-painter added.
  - tweak: Most pipe icons have been tweaked with shading and such, making it look
      more uniform.
  JJRcop:
  - rscadd: We have managed to re-discover drones! We improved the formula, and have
      discovered some cool stuff.
  - rscadd: After some fiddling with audio recognition, drones can now understand
      human speech!
  - rscadd: One of our engineers found some screws that were loose on some of our
      tests, screwing them in made the drone work as if it had just come out of robotics.
  - tweak: We had to sacrifice some of our NT brand EMP protection for the speech
      recognition, so drones can get damaged if subjected to heavy EMP radiation.
  - bugfix: We figured out why drones couldn't remove objects from people, that has
      been fixed.
  - bugfix: The standby light wasn't wired correctly.
  - rscdel: Unfortunately one of our assistants tasked with transporting the only
      copy of the data dropped the flash drive in hot water because he wanted to see
      what "drone tea" tasted like. You'll have to discover them again.
  Lo6a4evskiy:
  - rscadd: Station's crayons have been upgraded to the version 2.0 of ColourOS. Don't
      worry, they are still edible!
  - tweak: Many items now have different stripping delays. Heavier and more armored
      pieces of clothing are generally more difficult to take off someone else, while
      smaller items can be very easy to snatch. Pockets always take 4 seconds to search.
  MrPerson:
  - rscadd: Implants are activated via action buttons on the top-left corner of your
      screen instead of emotes.
  Paprika:
  - rscadd: Added zipties for security and nuke operatives. These have a slightly
      shorter 'breakout time' as normal cuffs but they are destroyed upon removal.
      Beepsky and sec borgs now use these by default.
  - bugfix: Changed the medical HUD in the tactical medkit to a night vision HUD so
      syndicate medics don't stumble around in the dark. Can be purchased through
      nuke op uplinks.
  - rscadd: Added a second roboticist roundstart job slot.
  - rscadd: Added a third cargo tech job slot.
  Paprka:
  - rscadd: Added undershirts as a companion piece to jumpsuit adjusting. Beat the
      heat with a comfortable tank top, or warm up with an extra layer tshirt!
  - rscadd: Added a holographic sign projector to replace the old wet floor signs
      to encourage janitors to warn crewmembers about wet floors.
  optimumtact:
  - rscadd: Medical supplies crate now comes with a boxy full of bodybags
2014-10-27:
  Jordie0608:
  - rscadd: Adds a new riot shotgun that spawns in the armory with a 6 round beanbag
      magazine.
  Paprika:
  - experiment: Allowed constructs to assist in activating most runes. This includes
      conversion runes, but does NOT include sacrifice runes.
  Patchouli Knowledge:
  - rscadd: In light of the recent achievements of the Robotics department, new and
      upgraded exosuit schematics were delivered to SS13 exosuit fabricators as a
      reward from CentComm.
  - rscadd: The countless hours of research, experimentation, and reverse-engineering
      of wrecks from the mining asteroid have paid off - the Research team has rediscovered
      the process of building Phazon exosuits. The parts and circuits have been made
      available in the exofabs and circuit printers.
  - rscadd: The APLU Ripley exosuit has been refitted with asteroid mining purposes
      in mind. Its armour plating will provide extra protection against the brute
      attacks of asteroid alien lifeforms, and protect from gibtonite explosions.
      The leg servos were upgraded to provide faster movement.
  - rscadd: There are rumours of some creative shaft miners discovering a way of augmenting
      APLU Ripley armour with trophy hides from goliath-type asteroid lifeforms...
  - tweak: Durand construction routines now require a phasic scanner module and a
      super capacitor to match Nanotrasen industry standards.
  - tweak: The exosuit fire extinguisher now boasts a larger watertank, and carries
      a whole 1000u of water from the old 200u tank.
  - tweak: The exosuit plasma converter's efficiency has been vastly improved upon,
      and its fuel consumption has been cut to nearly half of old values.
  - bugfix: The exosuit sleeper interiors have been refitted to allow the occupants
      more freedom of movement, and the occupants may now eject at will.
  - bugfix: The armour plating on all exosuits was fitted with reactive deflection
      systems specifically designed to stop the rapid slashes from xenomorph threats.
  - bugfix: The Firefighter Ripley chassis were moved from the Exosuit Equipment section
      to the APLU Ripley section of exofab menus.
  - spellcheck: Fixed some minor errors in the exosuit construction message syntax.
  phil235:
  - rscadd: Closets and its children can no longer contain a near infinite amount
      of mobs. Large mobs (juggernaut, alien emperess, etc) don't fit, small mobs
      (mouse, parrot, etc) still fit in the same amounts, human-sized mob (humanoid,
      slime, etc) fit but maximum two per body bag and three for all the other closets.
      Adding bluespace body bag to R&amp;D, it can hold even large mobs and in large
      amounts.
  - experiment: girders and displaced girders now have a chance to let projectiles
      pass through them.
2014-10-30:
  MrPerson:
  - rscadd: Everything now drifts in space, not just mobs.
  - rscadd: Mechs are just as maneuverable in space as you are.
  - tweak: Being weightless now slows movement down by a lot rather than speeding
      it up. Having your hands full will make movement even slower.
  - rscdel: Removed spaceslipping (You slipped! x1000)
  - bugfix: Jetpacking after being thrown out a mass driver will cancel out your momentum.
  - bugfix: Shooting a gun causes you to drift the other direction like spraying a
      fire extinguisher.
