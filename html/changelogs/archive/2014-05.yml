  /Tg/station Code Management:
  - wip: /tg/station code is now under a feature freeze until 7th June 2014. This
      means that the team will be concentrating on fixing bugs instead of adding features
      for the month.
  - bugfix: You can find more information about the feature freeze here. http://tgstation13.org/phpBB/viewtopic.php?f=5&amp;t;=273
  - bugfix: This is the perfect time to report bugs, which you can do so here. https://github.com/tgstation/-tg-station/issues/new

  - rscadd: A recent breakthrough in Plasma Materials Research has led to the development
      of a stronger, tougher plasteel alloy that can better resist extreme heat by
      up to four times. A live demonstration preformed during a press conference earlier
      today showed a segment of reinforced wall resisting an attack by Thermite. The
      corporation also announces that upgrades to its existing stations is already
      underway.

  - rscadd: 'Thanks to Nanotrasen''s Engineering division, the power wiring of the
      station has a received a complete overhaul. Here are the highlight features
      in CentCom report :'
  - tweak: 'Improved way of connecting cables! Finished is the time of "laying and
      praying" : it''s now as simple as matching ends of each cables!'
  - tweak: Unified way of connecting machines! Every machine is connected to a powernet
      through a node cable (it still needs to be anchored to receive power though)!
  - tweak: Lots of improvements in the cable cutting tools! Gone is the odd magic
      of physically separated yet still connected powernets (contact CentCom Engineering
      Division if you still witness something weird, we always have a fired form ready
      for our engineers!)!
  - rscadd: Any conscientious (or not!) Station Engineer may check an "updated wiring
      manual" at http://www.tgstation13.org/wiki/Wiring#Power_Wires

  - rscadd: 'After the years of extensive research into xenobiology, and thousands
      of scientists lost to the slimes, we have finally come to admitting that we
      don''t have a clue how they work. However, we''ve outlined a few facts, and
      managed to breed a new kind of slimes. They will be shipped to your station
      on the next shifts. They are different from the ones they are used to in the
      following:'
  - rscadd: Their sight is better than ever, and now they can finally see things that
      are not directly pressed against them. Beware, they may appear more aggressive!
  - rscadd: Their memory has also become better, and they will now remember the people
      who fed them. As a note, you need to grab the monkey or push it to show to the
      slime that you're giving it to them, and it's not just walking in.
  - rscadd: Apparently, not only we have studied them, but they have also studied
      us. Slimes are now capable of showing various emotions, mimicking humans. Use
      it to your advantage.
  - rscadd: There are reports of slimes showing signs of sentience. Further research
      is recommended.
  - rscadd: 'One of the reported signs is their speech capability. Following facts
      have been gathered: they talk more often to those who feed them; they react
      to being called by the number, but ''slimes'' is also acceptable; they are able
      to understand being ordered to "follow" someone, or "stop". There is a report
      of slime releasing the assistant after a scientist shouted at it, and then calmly
      ordered a slime to stop.'
  - rscadd: We've made a modification of a health scanner that is intended for the
      use on slimes. Two are available in the smartfridge.
  - tweak: We've come to a conclusion that 5 units of reagents are not necessary to
      cause slime core reactions. You actually only need one unit.
