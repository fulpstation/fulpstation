      them severely.

      the Syndicate.) via a comms console.  (This occurs in much the fashion as a
      prayer.)

  - unknown: I'm back home and resumed work on Newscasters and Contraband.
  - unknown: But I got bored and made cargo softcaps instead. Flippable! Enjoy, now
      all we need is deliverable pizzas.
  - unknown: "Oh, also enjoy some new bodybag functionality and sounds I had ready\
      \ a while ago, with sprites from Farart. Use a pen to create a visible tag on\
      \ the bodybag. Wirecutters to cut it off. Also it's no longer weldable because\
      \ it makes no goddamn sense.\n  "

  - unknown: "Reworked exosuit internal atmospherics (the situation when exosuit is\
      \ set to take air from internal tank, otherwise cabin air = location air): \n\
      \t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li>If current cabin presure is lower than &amp;quot;tank output\

  Doohl:
  - unknown: <b>The radio overhaul 'Telecommunications' is now LIVE.</b> Please submit
      any opinions/feedback in the forums and check the wiki article on Telecommunications
      for some more info for the curious.
  - unknown: The AI satellite has been replaced with a communications satellite. You
      can get there via teleporter or space, just like the AI satellite. I highly
      recommend not bum-rushing the new satellite, as you may be killed if you don't
      have access. It's a very secure place.
  - unknown: Once a human's toxicity level reaches a certain point, they begin throwing
      up. This is a natural, but overall ineffective method of purging toxins from
      the body.
  - unknown: You can now travel Z-levels in Nuclear Emergency mode (the nuke disk
      is still bound to the station). This means the nuclear agents can and probably
      will fly off into space to blow up the comm satellite and shut down communications.

  Doohl:
  - unknown: Syndicate shuttle now starts with a All-In-One telecommunication machine,
      which acts as a mini-network for the syndie channel. It intercepts all station
      radio activity, too, how cool is that?

      oxygen tanks, and breath masks.'
  LastyScratch:
  - unknown: Toggle-Ambience now works properly and has been moved from the OOC tab
      to the Special Verbs tab to be with all the other toggles.
  'Petethegoat updated (for a bunch of other people):':

  - unknown: Arresting buff!
  - unknown: A person in handcuffs being pulled cannot be bumped out of the way, nor
      can the person pulling them. They can still push through a crowd (they get bumped
      back to behind the person being pulled, or pushed ahead depending on intent).

  Agouri:
  - unknown: '<font face="terminal"><b>UPDATE ON THE UPDATE</b>: Newspapers are now
      fully working, sorry for that. Some minor icon bugs fixed. Now I''m free to
      work on the contest prizes :3</font>'
  - unknown: <b><font color="red">Newscasters are now LIVE!</font></b> Bug reports,
      suggestions for extra uses, tears etc go <a href="http://code.google.com/p/tgstation13/source/detail?r=3005"
      target="_blank">here</a>.
  - unknown: What <b>ARE</b> newscasters? Fans of the Transmetropolitan series might
      find them familiar. Basically, they're terminals connected to a station-wide
      news network. Users are able to submit channels of their own (one per identified
      user, with channels allowing feed stories by other people or, if you want the
      channel to be your very own SpaceJournal, being submit-locked to you), while
      others are able to read the channels, either through the terminals or a printed
      newspaper which contains every news-story circulating at the time of printing.
  - unknown: 'About censorship: You can censor channels and feed stories through Security
      casters, found in the HoS''es office and the Bridge. Alternatively, if you want
      a channel to stop operating completely, you can mark it with a D-Notice which
      will freeze it and make all its messages unreadable for the duration it is in
      effect. If you''ve got the access, of course.'
  - unknown: Basically I think of the newscaster as nothing more as an additional
      Roleplaying tool. Grab a newspaper along with your donuts and coffee from the
      machines, read station rumors when you're manning your desk, be a station adventurer
      or journalist with your very own network journal!
  - unknown: I would ask for a bit of respect when using the machine, though. I removed
      all and any channel and story restrictions regarding content, so you might end
      up seeing channels that violate the rules, Report those to the admins.
  - unknown: "Finally, due to the removal of the enforced \"Channel\" string, it's\
      \ recommended to name your channels properly (\"Station Paranormal Activity\
      \ Channel\" instead of \"Station Paranormal Activity\", for example\")\n\n  "

  Sieve:
  - unknown: This stuff is actually already implemented, it just didn't make it to
      the changelog
  - unknown: Firefighter Mech - A reinforced Ripley that is more resistant to better
      cope with fires, simply look in the Ripley Contruction manual for instructions.
  - unknown: Mech contruction now has sounds for each step, not just 1/4 of them.
  - unknown: Mech Fabricators are fixed, Manual Sync now works and certain reseach
      will reduce the time needed to build components.
  - unknown: Added special flaps to the mining station that disallow air-flow, removing
      the need to shuffle Ore Boxes through the Airlocks.
  - unknown: Each outpost has it's own system for the conveyors so they won't interfere
      with each other.
  - unknown: Powercell chargers have been buffed so now higher capacity cells are
      actually useable.
  - unknown: A diamond mech drill has been added. While it isn't any stronger than
      the standard drill, it is much faster.

  Carn:
  - unknown: Grammar &amp; various bug-fixes
  - unknown: Thank-you to everyone who reported spelling/grammar mistakes. I'm still
      working on it, so if you spot anymore please leave a comment <a href="http://nanotrasen.com/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=3&amp;t=7578"
      target="_blank">here</a>. There's still lots to fix.
  - unknown: Mining station areas should no longer lose air.
