  - wip: <b>Central Security has approved an upgrade of the Securitron line of bots
      to a newer model.</b><br/> Highlights include:<br/>
  - rscadd: -An optional setting to arrest personnel without an ID on their uniform
      (Disabled by default)
  - rscadd: -An optional setting to notify security personnel of arrests made by the
      bots (Enabled by default)
  - rscadd: -A new "Weapon Permit" access type that securitrons will use during their
      weapons checks. Personnel who work with weapons will be granted this access
      by default. More can be assigned by the station's Head of Security and Personnel.
  - tweak: -A more robust threat assessment algorithm to improve accuracy in identifying
      perpetrators.
  Rolan7:
  - rscadd: Fixed the irrigation system in hydroponics trays.  Adding at least 30
      units of liquid at once will activate the system, sharing the reagents between
      all connected trays.
  - bugfix: Changelings can communicate while muzzled or monkified, and being monkified
      doesn't stop them from taking human form.
  - bugfix: Mimes cannot break the laws of physics unless their vow is currently active.
  - rscadd: Trays are rewritten to make sense and so borgs can actually use them.  Service
      borgs can discretely carry small objects, hint hint.  The items are easily knocked
      out of them.

  - rscadd: Recently the Space Wizard Federation, with some assistance from the Cult
      of Nar-Sie, recently created a new strain of Killer Tomato. A sad side effect
      is this effected all current and future Killer Tomato strains in our galaxy.

      when growing them.

  - rscadd: We, of the NanoTrasen Botany Research and Developent(NTBiRD), has some
      important announcements for the Botany staff aboard our stations.
  - rscadd: We have recently released a new strain of Tower Cap. It is now ensured
      that more planks can be gotten from a single log.
  - rscadd: Head Scientist [REDACTED] is thanked for his new strain of Blood Tomatoes.
      It now not only contains human blood, but also chunks of human flesh!
  - rscadd: We have also discovered a way to replant the infamous Cash Trees and 'Eggy'
      plants. We can now harvest their seeds, and the rare products are inside the
      fruit shells.
  - rscadd: Similar to the new variety of Tower Caps, it is now possible to get various
      grass flooring depending on the plants potency!
  - rscadd: Our sponsors at Knitters United has released a new variation of the botany
      Aprons and Coveralls which can hold a larger variety of items!
  - rscadd: A new version of Plant-B-Gone was produced which are much more lethal
      to plants, yet at the same time has no extra effect on humans besides the norm.
  Paprika:
  - tweak: Tweaked mining turf mineral droprates and reverted mesons to the 'old'
      style of mesons. This means mesons will be more powerful with the added side
      effect of not being able to track individual light sources through walls and
      such. This is a trial run; please provide feedback on the /tg/ codebase section
      of the forum.
