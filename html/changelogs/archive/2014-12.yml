  Ergovisavi:
  - rscadd: Allows using replica pods to clone people without bodies.
  - tweak: Speeds up replica pod cloning by adjusting the starting production.
  - tweak: Replica pods will now only create plantmen.
  - tweak: Mixing blood in a beaker or taking it from a suicide victim will render
      the blood sample useless for replica pod cloning.
  GunHog:
  - rscadd: Our top Nanotrasen scientists have provided improved specifications for
      the Rapid Part Exchange Device (RPED)! The RPED can now contain up to 50 machine
      components, and will display identical items in groups when using its inventory
      interface.
  - rscadd: Note that power cells, being somewhat bulkier, will take up more space
      inside the device. In addition, the RPED's firmware has also been updated to
      assist in new machine construction! Simply have the required components inside
      the RPED, apply it to an unfinished machine with its circuit board installed,
      and watch as the device does the work!
  - rscadd: Nanotrasen has updated station bound Artificial Intelligence unit design
      specifications to include an integrated subspace radio transmitter. The transmitter
      is programmed with all standard department channels, along with the inclusion
      of its private channel. It is accessed using :o in its interface.
  - rscadd: '{INCOMING CLASSIFIED SYNDICATE TRANSMISSION} Greetings, agents! Today,
      we are happy to announce that we have successfully reverse engineered the new
      subspace radio found in Nanotrasen''s newest AI build plans. We have included
      our encryption data into these transmitters.'
  - rscadd: Should you be deployed with one of our agent AIs, it may be wise of you
      to purchase a syndicate encryption key in order to contact it securely. Remember,
      as with other agents, a Syndicate AI is unlikely to be of the same Syndicate
      corporation as you, and you both may actually have conflicting mission parameters!
      Your channel, as always, is accessed using :t.
  Paprika:
  - tweak: Changed the way flashbang protection works. Currently, only security helmets
      (and their derivatives like swat and riot), and some hardsuit helmets have flashbang
      protection. Ear items like earmuffs and 'bowman' headsets (alternative, larger
      headsets) have flashbang protection as well, so you're able to go hatless as
      security. The Head of security, warden, and detective's hat do NOT have flashbang
      protection, but their earpieces do, from the 'noise' part of the flashbang.
      The flashbang blind still works as before, with only sunglasses/hardsuit helmets
      protecting you.
  Tkdrg:
  - tweak: Security/Medical HUDs are now more responsive and less laggy.

  GunHog:
  - rscadd: The Nanotrasen firmware update 12.05.14 for station AI units and cyborgs
      includes a patch to give them more control of their automatic speech systems.
      They can now chose if the message should be broadcasted with their installed
      radio system and any frequency available to them.
  Paprika:
  - rscadd: Added winter coats and winter boots! Bundle up for space xmas! They are
      available in most wardrobe and job lockers, and come with special features depending
      on the flavor!
  Paprka:
  - rscadd: Added a new weapon for syndicate boarding parties, the C-90gl assault
      rifle. This is a hybrid rifle with a lot of damage and a grenade launcher alt-fire.
      Purchasable for 18TC.
  - tweak: Suppressors can now be used on the protolathe SMG and the C-20r.
  RemieRichards:
  - tweak: Sounds in areas of low pressure (E.g. Space) are now much quieter
  - tweak: To hear someone in space you need to be stood next to them, or use a radio
  as334:
  - rscadd: We've discovered that slimes react to the introduction of certain chemicals
      in their bloodstream. Inaprovaline will decrease the slimes children's chance
      of mutation, and plasma will increase it.
  - rscadd: We've also found that feeding slimes solid plasma bars makes them more
      friendly to humans.

  Paprika:
  - tweak: Reverted security armor and helmets to the old (Grey) style of armor/helmets.
  - tweak: Updated security jumpsuits to be more consistent across officer/warden/HoS
      ranks.
  - rscadd: Added tactical armor and helmets to replace the largely unused bulletproof
      vest in the armory. This armor has higher bullet and explosive resistance than
      normal armor, and uses the previous, more military armor/helmet sprites.
  - rscadd: Added a new injury doll to go along with the overall health meter. This
      will show you locational overall limb-based burn/brute damage, so you can tell
      the difference between being hurt with burn/brute or toxins/stamina damage which
      does not affect limbs.
  - tweak: Reverted some UI icons back to their older status and changed some around
      for readability. Thank you for your feedback.
  Thunder12345:
  - rscadd: Added a new FRAG-12 explosive shotgun shell, built from the unloaded technological
      shell, using tablecrafting. Constructed using an unloaded technological tech
      shell, 5 units sulphuric acid, 5 units polytrinic acid, 5 units glycerol, and
      requires a screwdriver.
  phil235:
  - rscadd: 'Change to the hunger system. Eating food with sugar temporarily worsens
      your nutrition drop rate. Eating too much sugar too quickly can make you temporarily
      unable to eat any sugary food. The nutritional effect of sugar depends on how
      hungry you are thus it cannot easily  raise your nutrition level past well fed
      and is best used when hungry. Lots of sugar can make you a bit jittery at times.
      Eating food with vitamin (new reagent) counteracts the sugar effects and can
      give you temporary buffs when well fed: it lowers your chance to catch or spread
      viruses,it makes your body''s metabolism more efficient that is it keeps healing
      reagents longer and evacuate toxins faster and reduces damage from radioactive
      reagents. Your metabolism gets less efficient if starving.'
  - rscadd: 'New hunger hud icons: starving, hungry, fed, well fed, full, fat.'
  - rscadd: Snack vending machine get a chef compartment that can be loaded with non-sugary
      food by hand or with a tray by anyone with kitchen access (unless you hack the
      machine with multitool or emag). The food can be unloaded by anyone, like regular
      snacks
  - rscadd: Cargo can get a nutritious pizza crate order for 60 points.
  - tweak: Grown and cooked food gets some vitamin while junk food gets less nutriment
      and more sugar (only hot donkpocket and ramen don't have sugar)
  - tweak: The number of junk food in snack vending machine is lowered from 6 to 5
      of each type.
  - bugfix: Fixing not being able to load an omelette du fromage on a tray.
2014-12-27:
  Dorsidwarf:
  - tweak: Buffs the RCD from 30 matter units to max capacity 100, and increases the
      value of matter charges.
  Paprika:
  - experiment: Taser electrodes now have a limited range of 7 tiles.
  - experiment: The energy gun's stun mode has been replaced with a disable mode.
  - experiment: Security officers will now spawn with tasers.
  - tweak: Disabler beams now go through windows and grilles.
  - tweak: Disabler beams now do 33 stamina damage instead of 34. This means they
      will only stun in 3 hits on someone that is NOT 100% healthy.
  - tweak: Most ballistic projectiles now do stamina damage in addition to their regular
      damage instead of stunning. This includes nuke op c-20r .45, detective's revolver,
      etc. They are effectively better than disablers at stunning people, as well
      as do significant damage, but they do not stun instantly like a taser. Expect
      engagements to be a little longer and plan ahead for this.
  - rscadd: Added an advanced taser for RnD, the child of a disabler and a taser.
  Tkdrg:
  - rscadd: Envoys from the distant Viji sector have brought an exotic contraption
      to Centcomm. Known as the 'supermatter shard', it is a fragment of an ancient
      alien artifact, believed to have a dangerous and mysterious power. This precious
      item has been made available to the Space Station 13 cargo team for the cost
      of a hundred supply points, as a reward for all your hard work. Good luck, and
      stay safe.
