  ArcaneDefence:
  - bugfix: Janitor cyborgs are no longer capable of placing their bucket module on

      head will be met with failure.
  Arkatos:
  - bugfix: Emagging escape pod console will now properly allow you to launch the
      pod even without required alert level. Farewell, security!
  Ghilker:

      name of a var, now the gui works again, also the internal gasmixture wasn't
      initialized anymore for some reason
  - balance: changed some recipe to cost less, zaukerite and SM shard cost a bit less
      now (was intended to be changed in the main PR but i forgot)
  Qustinnus, Kryson & uglykoala:
  - rscadd: 'Ethereals now crystalize on death, allowing them to heal themselves unless
      the crystal is destroyed, but giving them a brain trauma when its succesful.
      tweak: ethereals now stay emagged for longer'
  cacogen:
  - code_imp: Should be less likely to get inedible food now
  - bugfix: Slicing penguin meat slabs into raw cutlets should work again
2021-03-02:
  Dex:

      combat mode.

  - admin: adds some flags to the admin bitflag menus
  Ghilker:
  - bugfix: xenos and random event mobs can't spawn in atmos tanks

  - bugfix: Admins can now correctly force midround rulesets.
  Paxilmaniac:
  - bugfix: several duplicate items around metastation have been removed
  Qustinnus:
  - soundadd: Ethereals can now scream
  Ryll/Shaps:
  - rscadd: You can now smack your hand on tables to emphasize a point! Simply ready
      a slapper with *slap, then click on an empty table! Doing so with a left-click
      lets you fire off a series of weaker slaps, while a right-click makes one big,
      loud slam for maximum impact!
  - bugfix: Right clicking someone in combat mode as a hulk will now shove them, like
      it does for normal humans
  SparkezelPL:
  - imageadd: Adds new radiation collector array sprites. If an array is turned on
      but has no tanks, it now displays an error animation.
  - spellcheck: Removes "Hawking Radiation" in arrays with just radiation. It was
      nice to know you singulo...
  Thalpy:
  - bugfix: Fixes the randomly failing unit test that sometimes happens.
  Timberpoes:
  - balance: ID cards have now completely changed. ID cards have limited available
      access slots increased by card rarity and the specific job trim. Jobs with more
      innate access now have more valuable ID cards. Better watch your backs!
  - balance: Yes, this means that you can no longer mass-distribute unrestricted All
      Access. During War Ops, you're expected to protect the diskie and disk holder.
      Sec can distribute guns. Cargo can order guns. You can still get key accesses
      like Maint on any ID card. HoP can still create and trim special silver ID cards
      for high value staff members to get more access. Adapt. Overcome. Suffer.
  - balance: 'Chameleon ID cards are completely reworked. Instead of copying all accesses
      from a card, they now open up an interface where you can select up to 5 accesses
      to copy over depending on the target card''s access. tweak: The ID Console has
      been updated to reflect these new changes including a somewhat improved layout.
      You can apply job templates direct to cards via a drop-down interface and these
      templates will attempt to fill out as many accesses on the card as it can based
      on the card''s trim and the template''s wildcard setup. tweak: The PDA Painter
      has now been upgraded with a tgui interface. It can be used to paint PDAs the
      same as before, but can now also change the trim on ID cards. This procedure
      will remove all access levels from the ID card in the process, leaving you with
      a freshly trimmed blank ID card. tweak: Captain job trims now have a white star
      instead of a dull grey star. removed: Mining Conscript Card has been removed
      and replaced with a spare mining ID that holds and has the access the Conscript
      card gave. tweak: The Captain''s Spare ID has been moved from the Captain''s
      locker to a secure safe on the bridge. The highest ranking Command member on
      shift start is given the codes to this safe, generally following the chain of
      command. The QM is part of this and can, in exceptional circumstances where
      no other heads join the shift, become Acting Captain. Their ID card would be
      given Bridge access if they were picked as Acting Captain to allow them to access
      the captain''s spare. If nobody in the chain of command joins the shift, the
      next latejoined player from the chain of command will be given the codes for
      the spare and promoted to Acting Captain automatically. tweak: The secure safe
      on the bridge is a special variant that is immune to conventional weaponry and
      lacks the hacking mechanic of ordinary wall safes. Maybe if you could examine
      it close enough, you''d find hints to its weaknesses... tweak: Examining players
      now shows a more detailed representation of any ID card in their ID slot.'
  - rscadd: Added the world's worst coder sprites for ID card overlays including PDA,
      Laptop and Wallet icons for when they're in the ID Card slot too. May God have
      mercy on your souls, for my spriting skills have none.
  necromanceranne:
  - rscadd: Adds basic cybernetic eyes to the medical protolathe and mechfab. Adds
      improved cybereyes (equal to human eyes) to the Cybernetic Organs tech node.
  - bugfix: Fixes up a missing sprite when wearing the durathread bandana on your
      head.
2021-03-03:

  Qustinnus:
  - soundadd: French tourists now have their own audio cue
  TemporalOroboros:
  - bugfix: A recent firmware update reenabled the screens on Nanotransen brand computers.
  - bugfix: Bloodsplatter no longer experiences phantom limb syndrome on people missing
      both of their arms.
  - bugfix: Recent budget cuts have resulted in accessories no longer having magnets
      strong enough to pull bloodstains directly out of clothing. Washing machine
      usage has jumped 50% over the last week.
  - bugfix: No one is entirely certain who injected the the design schema for neon
      error signs into the mind magnification helmet production line, but the affected
      units have been recalled and the perpetrator <i>will</i> be brought to justice.
  Timberpoes:
  - qol: Plexus Access Management app has had the Basic tab renamed to Trim to indicate
      that these accesses are available because of the card's trim. It also has an
      access counter so players can see they're able to change it.
  - qol: Plexus Access Management app has had the logic for displaying the used/available
      accesses for any given wildcard inverted. It now shows Used/Max instead of Available/Max.
  - bugfix: Wallets no longer show redundant examine text.
  Time-Green:
  - rscadd: Plumbing reaction chambers now have connects for acidic (yellow) and basic
      (green) buffers! You can set the UI to indicate at what pH the reaction chamber
      is supposed to insert a buffer into the reaction.
  - rscadd: Adds plumbing bufferers. Place a bunch of them next to each other, set
      a threshold amount with right click and screwdriver them. Once all are above
      the threshold, only then will they start providing chems. Great for waiting
      steps and carefully dosing amounts!
  - balance: The reaction chamber no longer pulls specific chems, and instead has
      a set volume it works towards before being able to react.
  carshalash:
  - balance: Oxidates blue cherries and makes parsnips cause Alzheimer's
  mozi_h:
  - rscadd: Folders have a snazzy new look. (Check out those colours!)
  - qol: Rapidly pick up paper by clicking on it with a folder. Alt-click to remove
      an item from a folder.

      to singulo.
  - code_imp: Supermatter's defines have been moved into it's own file in the __DEFINES
      folder.

  Timberpoes:
  - bugfix: The Plexagon Access Management app has been upgraded and allows Heads
      of Staff to demote any ID card that has a trim they'd ordinarily be able to
      apply as a template. This means the HoS can now demote departmental sec officers
      like Security Officer (Science).
  YakumoChen:
  - rscadd: A less-than-new Syndicate Special bundle reminds you of the good old days
      when we didn't need all those newfangled traitor items the young-uns get. We
      had 6 items in the uplink and we had Monkey in rotation and by god we made do.
  tralezab:
  - rscadd: The Chef now has a produce console for ordering ingredients! Botanists
      are still the best way to get stuff, though.
  - spellcheck: fixed typo on the engineering voidsuit
  - rscadd: Minebots treads now make noise as they move!
2021-03-05:
  ATHATH:
  - refactor: The definition of the transfer_blood variable (of gloves) has been moved
      from the file that otherwise only contains the code of damp rags to the file
      that defines the other variables of gloves, and has also been documented.
  - balance: Radioactive microlasers can no longer knock out creatures who are immune
      to the effects of radiation.
  - bugfix: The radioactive microlaser now calculates the strength of its delay effect
      using the intensity setting it had when you initially used it on your victim,
      not the intensity setting it currently has. This prevents people from "cheating
      out" its intensity 20 effect with only a 2 second delay and a 1 second cooldown.
  - balance: Radioactive microlasers no longer contain twice as much metal as normal
      health analyzers do.
  ArcaneDefence:
  - bugfix: Monkey kind has rediscovered the lost art of wearing a pet collar. Celebrate

      Experiment!
  EdgeLordExe:
  - rscadd: Adds a new system for handling organ failure, the old system is still
      there for organs that havent been ported yet.
  - rscadd: Liver is now using the new system for organ failure, which means that
      once it reaches 100 damage (liver is dead) it will give you a 1 minute warning
      period for you to get to medbay, after that 1 minute the effects of liver failure
      will slowly ramp up to comparably old levels of deadliness.
  Foxtrot (Funce):

  LemonInTheDark:

  Thalpy:
  - qol: Tweaks cryostylane to use the new reaction mechanics, incorporating stasis
      iceblocks, freezing, temporary organ decay prevention and surgery slows. Cryostylane
      when added to a corpse will tint them blue and pause organ decay temporarily,
      while it is in a mob it will slow down all surgery applied upon them. Inverse
      cryostylane will freeze you in a block of ice and put you in stasis (living
      and dead).
  - qol: Tweaks cyrostylane to have a more indepth reaction, where colder temperatures
      will cause it's purity to decrease.
  - code_imp: cleans up some of holder.dm code and adds a REAGENT_IGNORE_STASIS bitflag.

  - bugfix: Stops revenants gaining obscenely large essence (AKA health + power) pools
      by draining dying monkeys.

      from toxin heals too.

      layers and they keep the pipelines separated and sprite fix due to layer 1 and
      5
  - bugfix: thermomachines can't be built on same layer pipes
  SuperNovaa41:
  - spellcheck: fixed a spacing issue
  Timberpoes:
  - bugfix: Departmental sec officers now appear on the crew manifest as sec.
  - bugfix: The new ID card system no longer ignores server config settings and will
      respect lowpop/highpop access settings in the config. This mean that highpop
      shifts no longer grant players lowpop access levels when the appropriate config
      entries are set.
  - config: As I am happy with the status quo, the headmins have agreed to disable
      the config entry that was being ignored due to the above bug. Players should
      not notice any new roundstart ID access changes by the time they're reading
      this changelog entry and will hopefully start with maximum job access at any
      population level because it is intended, rather than because of a bug.

      input in the UI. The gases are not free tho (unless the atmos man that is managing
      the sender just set them free), you will have to pay a sum based on the gas
      price times the gas amounts, the sum will be taken from your card and sent to
      the engi department.
