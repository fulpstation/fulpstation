  - expansion: "The Mr. Deempisi Portrait plaque has been replaced with a very special picture frame: A small picture of one out four random things (Mr. Deempisi included) that can have a photo affixed over it. The photo will persist between rounds on that specific station until removed of if the frame is destroyed. Each station gets one, all but one (Kilo is too damn cramped) located in the bar behind the bartender counter. It's also more artsy than other picture frames now.
spriteadd: Desouled the picture frame sprites."
