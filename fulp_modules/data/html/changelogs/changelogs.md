# Changelogs

When a PR is merged, a corresponding changelog file is created in `fulp_modules/data/html/changelogs`. Those files are then collected together, monthly, and saved here for long term preservation. TG does this too, in their `html/changelogs` folder.

## Writing a changelog

While, technically, you can write a changelog by hand, there's no reason to do so. For a very long time now, the process of creating and formatting changelog files has been automated through github actions.

All that you need to do is to fill out the "Changelog" section of your PR while following the indicated format.
