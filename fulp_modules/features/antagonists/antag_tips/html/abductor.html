	<p>You and your teammate have been chosen by the mothership to go and capture some humans.</p>
	<p>There's two of you: the <b>scientist</b>, who must oversee the camera and surgery, and the <b>agent</b>, who must go down on the station to stun and cuff people.</p>
	<p><img src="scitool.png"/>The scientist must utilize his <b>console</b> and <b>science tool</b>, to scan disguises and scan the agent for retrieval if neccesary.</p>
	<p>The scientist must look for targets and send down the agent, after the target is captured the scientist must go down and use the science tool to mark the teleport target.</p>
	<p><img src="alienorgan.png"/>After that, he must do the <b>extraterrestrial experimental surgery</b>, which doesn't require any clothing to be removed.</p>
	<p><img src="abaton.png"/>The agent must be sent down by the scientist to stun and cuff a target and drag it into a hidden spot and wait for the scientist.</p>
	<p>People wearing <b>tinfoil hats</b> are immune to the sleep effect of abductor batons.</p>
