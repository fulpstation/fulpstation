	<h1>You are a Revolutionary!</h1>
	<img src="stunprod.png"/>
	<p>You are a revolutionary tasked with eliminating the heads of staff. You can accomplish this either by exile or assassination.</p>
	<p><img src="headrevhud.png"/>There are <b>Head Revolutionaries</b> who are the leaders of the revolution, and MUST stay alive (and on station) at ALL costs.</p>
	<p><img src="flash.png"/>Head Revolutionaries use <b>flashes</b> to convert people to the revolution, this doesn't work on people with mindshields or flash protection.</p>
	<p><img src="revhud.png"/>People with this <b>icon</b> are your fellow revolutionaries, help them accomplish your objectives.</p>
	<p><img src="implanter.png"/>In the case of being <b>mindshielded</b> or being bashed in the head with blunt weapons, you'll get deconverted. Avoid THIS at all costs.</p>
	<p>Don't be afraid to ask <b>mentors</b> for help using the mentorhelp button.</p>
