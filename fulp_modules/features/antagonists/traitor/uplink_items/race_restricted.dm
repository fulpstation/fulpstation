	desc = "A living beefplushie specimen. It looks very simmilar to a normal beefman plushie, use this to your advantage. Pet it to make the specimen produce the meat, \
	providing it has gotten time to get ready again. Upon investigating beefman origins, we stumbled upon a new method to effectively generate infinite meat. \
	With the help of cytology and beefman cells we managed to create specimens able to generate meat if given the time to produce it. \
	They are in very limited number however, so we are only distributing them to beefman operatives in hopes of getting the most use out of them."
