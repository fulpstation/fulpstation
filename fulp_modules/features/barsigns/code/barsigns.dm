/**
 * So what exactly is going on here?
 *
 * Barsign unit testing requires a .dmi file has all icon states, and the icon checked for these icon states is the bar sign's icon
 * Because of this, we either add our signs to TG's file, or add TG's signs to ours, then use our dmi file.
 * The problem with this is if TG changes how their signs look, we wouldn't update.
 * Therefore, we keep the old system that will keep using TG's dmi for TG barsigns, therefore we only use our version of said signs for Ci
 * Knowing they exist, then swapping to TG's anyways.
 *
 * Of course, none of this would be needed if it weren't for TG hardcoding everything, and it would mean Ci actually matters. Sucks to suck.
