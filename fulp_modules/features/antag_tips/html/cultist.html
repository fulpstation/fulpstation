	<h1>You are a Blood Cultist!</h1>
	<img src="bloodcult.png"/>
	<p>You are a follower of the geometer of blood, Nar'Sie!</p>
	<p>In your bag, you will find some <b>Runed Metal</b> and a <b>Ritual Dagger.</b></p>
	<p><img src="dagger.png"/>Use your <b>Ritual Dagger</b> to create runes. Each rune has a unique function.</p>
	<p><img src="archives.png"/>Use the <b>Runed Metal</b> to create cult structures which will produce powerful equipment.</p>
	<p><img src="sacrune.png"/>To begin, you should gather converts by placing them over an <b>Offering Rune.</b></p>
	<p>There will be several other cultists on board, communicate with them using the commune button. Find a place to create a base, and keep cult structures hidden.</p>
	<p>Before you can summon Nar'Sie, you must first sacrifice a target for her on an offering rune. Check the top right of your screen for information on your target.</p>
	<p><b>NOTE: Your Cult Stun spell will not have full effect on Mindshielded people -- consider using alternative tactics when dealing with them.</b></p>
	<p>Don't be afraid to ask <b>mentors</b> for help using the mentorhelp button.</p>
