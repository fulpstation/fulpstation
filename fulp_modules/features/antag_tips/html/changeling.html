	<h1>You are a Changeling!</h1>
	<img src="changeling.png"/>
	<p>You are a Changeling, a shapeshifting alien assuming the form of a crewmember on Space Station 13.</p>
	<p>You have the ability to take genomes, which serve as backup identities. To do this, you must take ANY human, and acquire their DNA through one of two methods.</p>
	<p><img src="sting_extract.png"/>Use the <b>DNA Extraction Sting</b> and sting a target to stealthily steal their DNA.</p>
	<p><img src="absorb.png"/>You can <b>absorb</b> humans to drain their DNA, husking them and draining them of fluids.</p>
	<p><img src="emporium.png"/>Use the <b>Cellular Emporium</b> to acquire special abilities which will help you achieve your objectives.</p>
	<p>Absorbing a body will allow you to <b>readapt</b> and purchase different abilities.</p>
	<p><img src="tentacle.png"/>Although you are difficult to kill, stealth and deception is your friend. Be cautious: other changelings could have an objective to absorb you.</p>
