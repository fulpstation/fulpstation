	<h1>You are a Bloodsucker!</h1>
	<img src="bloodsucker.png"/>
	<p>You are a Bloodsucker, an undead blood-seeking monster living aboard Space Station 13.</p>
	<p>You regenerate your health slowly, you're weak to fire, and you depend on blood to survive. Don't allow your blood to run too low, or you'll enter a Frenzy!</p>
	<p><img src="day.png"/>Fear the daylight! Solar flares will bombard the station periodically, and your coffin can guarantee your safety.</p>
	<p><img src="masquerade.png"/>Medical and Genetic Analyzers can sell you out, your Masquerade ability will forge results for you to prevent this.</p>
	<p><img src="coffin.png"/>Rest in a <b>Coffin</b> to claim it, and that area, as your lair.</p>
	<p>Once you have a Coffin claimed, you will learn new structures in the <b>Tribal</b> section of your crafting menu.</p>
	<p><img src="vassalrack.png"/>Examine your new structures to see how they work to your advantage.</p>
	<p>Beware: Other Bloodsuckers are not necessarily your friends, but your survival may depend on cooperation. Betray them at your own discretion and peril.</p>
