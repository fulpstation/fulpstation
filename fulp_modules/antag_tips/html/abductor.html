	<p><img src="scitool.png"/>The scientist must utilize his <b>console</b> and <b>science tool</b>, to scan disguises and scan the agent for retrieval if neccesary.</p>
	<p>The scientist must look for targets and send down the agent, after the target is captured the scientist must go down and use the science tool to mark as the teleport target.</p>
