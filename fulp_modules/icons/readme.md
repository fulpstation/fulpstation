# Icons Folder

Previously, icons used to be stored in the folder with the feature they were added with.

Now, they are put into their own folder. This is to ensure that all icons are in their own /icons/ folder, so any feature (such as `is_valid_dmi_file`) will know it's an icon. This did cause issues in the past, so this is to ensure it never happens again.
