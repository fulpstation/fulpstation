/*
The /tg/ codebase allows mixing of hardcoded and dynamically-loaded z-levels.
Z-levels can be reordered as desired and their properties are set by "traits".
See map_config.dm for how a particular station's traits may be chosen.
The list DEFAULT_MAP_TRAITS at the bottom of this file should correspond to
the maps that are hardcoded, as set in _maps/_basemap.dm. SSmapping is
responsible for loading every non-hardcoded z-level.

As of 2018-02-04, the typical z-levels for a single-level station are:
1: CentCom
2: Station
3-4: Randomized space
5: Mining
6: City of Cogs
7-11: Randomized space
12: Empty space
13: Transit space

Multi-Z stations are supported and multi-Z mining and away missions would
require only minor tweaks.
