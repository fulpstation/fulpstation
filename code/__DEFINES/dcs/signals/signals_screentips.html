These are used for items that are defined by their behavior. They define their contextual text within <em>themselves</em>,
not in their targets.
Examples include syringes (LMB to inject, RMB to draw) and health analyzers (LMB to scan health/wounds, RMB for chems)
Items can override <code>add_item_context()</code>, and call <code>register_item_context()</code> in order to easily connect to this.
Called on /obj/item with a mutable screentip context list, the hovered target, and the mob hovering.
A screentip context list is a list that has context keys (SCREENTIP_CONTEXT_*, from __DEFINES/screentips.dm)
that map to the action as text.
If you mutate the list in this signal, you must return CONTEXTUAL_SCREENTIP_SET.</td></tr>
