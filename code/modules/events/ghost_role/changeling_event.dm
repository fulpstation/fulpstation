/*
* Changeling midround spawn event. Takes a ghost volunteer and stuffs them into a changeling with their own identity and a flesh space suit.
* They arrive via a meateor, which collides with the station. They are expected to find their own way into the station by whatever means necessary.
* The midround changeling experience is, by nature, more difficult than playing as a roundstart crew changeling.
