/**
 * A test to make sure harvesting plants in hydroponics results in the correct number of plants with the correct chemicals inside of it.
 *
 * We plant a seed into a tray and harvest it with a human.
 * This seed is set to have the maximum potency and yield with no instability to prevent mutations.
 * Then we check how many products we got from the harvest. For most plants, this should be 10 products, as we have a yield of 10.
 * Alternatively, if the plant has a trait that halves the products on harvest, it should result in 5 products.
 *
 * After we harvest our seed, we check for the plant's nutriments and vitamins.
 * Most plants have nutriments, so most plants should result in a number of nutriments.
 * Some plants have vitamins and some don't, so we then check the number of vitamins.
 * Additionally, the plant may have traits that double the amount of chemicals it can hold. We check the max volume in that case and adjust accordingly.
 * Plants may have additional chemicals genes that we don't check.
 * Plants may have traits that effect the final product's contents that we don't check.
 * Chemicals may react inside of the plant on harvest, which we don't check.
 *
 * After we check the harvest and the chemicals in the harvest, we go ahead and clean up the harvested products and remove the seed if it has perennial growth.
 *
 * This test checks both /obj/item/food/grown items and /obj/item/grown items since, despite both being used in hydroponics,
 * they aren't the same type so everything that works with one isn't guaranteed to work with the other.
