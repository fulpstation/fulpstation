 * Kudzu Flower Bud
 *
 * A flower created by flowering kudzu which spawns a venus human trap after a certain amount of time has passed.
 *
 * A flower created by kudzu with the flowering mutation.  Spawns a venus human trap after 2 minutes under normal circumstances.
 * Also spawns 4 vines going out in diagonal directions from the bud.  Any living creature not aligned with plants is damaged by these vines.
 * Once it grows a venus human trap, the bud itself will destroy itself.

 * Venus Human Trap
 *
 * The result of a kudzu flower bud, these enemies use vines to drag prey close to them for attack.
 *
 * A carnivorious plant which uses vines to catch and ensnare prey.  Spawns from kudzu flower buds.
 * Each one has a maximum of four vines, which can be attached to a variety of things.  Carbons are stunned when a vine is attached to them, and movable entities are pulled closer over time.
 * Attempting to attach a vine to something with a vine already attached to it will pull all movable targets closer on command.
 * Once the prey is in melee range, melee attacks from the venus human trap heals itself for 10% of its max health, assuming the target is alive.
 * Akin to certain spiders, venus human traps can also be possessed and controlled by ghosts.
