	<B>Day 014 - Code 104</B> -> Another issue with Researcher Smith, who was found to be using the chem dispensers to produce low-grade stimulants. Head Occultist Valentin seemed incredibly upset at the relatively harmless drugs, and has banned all production of stimulants.<BR>\
	<B>Day 022 - Code ???</B> -> The HO and Armstrong are bickering, unsure about what, but since what Armstrong's suggesting will stop that horrific noise, I'm siding with them. The HO gave me a nasty look when I spoke up about the lack of sleep.<BR>\
	<B>Day 034 - Code 109</B> -> Doctor Beaches apparently entered a restricted area during the off hours to check on a research sample without the Head Occultist's permission. A curfew has been installed.<BR>\
	<B>Day 047 - Code 311</B> -> Researcher Armstrong w... okay, the HO stopped watching, Elias is fucking losing it. I'm not allowed in the research labs unless there's an incident, but you can HEAR screaming from the lobby. Everyone is on edge. Jexa has been bolted into their room for protesting something, not sure.<BR>\
	<B>Day 051 - Code ???</B> -> The Head Occultist has been acting strange again, he's up at night in the lab, not eating, not sleeping. He's been giving the team these speeches about how close we are, I'm not paid enough to know what we're close to though.<BR>\
	<B>Day 052 - Ongoing Incident</B> -> Explosion from the research lab, going to check on it now. I think I hear Dreams-of-Beaches screaming.")

	<B>03:32 AM</B> - An older human wearing a red-white labcoat paces back and forth in the lab, staring at a half drawn rune in the containment zone. He soon leaves, muttering to himself.<BR>\
	<B>03:38 AM</B> - The camera pans to see the rune spark to life, sickly green light ignites the lab for a moment, and then shuts down.<BR>\
	<B>08:29 AM</B> - The doors to the lab opens, the red-labcoat from earlier, and another doctorly looking man enter, they're deep in conversation. A third, younger human in an orange labcoat enters, and the discussion stops. The researchers mill about, soon joined by another human, and a lizardperson.<BR>\
	<B>9:03 AM</B> - An emaciated and masked man is brought into the center of the lab onto the rune. His restraints are removed, and he goes to the rune, drawing at it with a glowing finger.<BR>\
	<B>9:04 AM</B> - The man in orange enters the cell, to the visible shock of the research team. He injects the emaciated man with a syringe.<BR>\
	<B>9:05 AM</B> - All hell breaks loose, the man in orange is dead on the spot, torn into shreds by whips of eldritch flame. Rust creeps across the lab, and skittering creatures drag the red-labcoat off camera.<BR>\
	<B>9:06 AM</B> - A security guard enters and draws their weapon, but the ground under their feet erupts into flames. From off-camera, a beast of arms tears at the doctorly man.<BR>\
	<B>9:07 AM</B> - The remaining scientist grabs the cowering lizardperson, and the two leave the lab. The emaciated man seems to be in pain as camera-distoring energy racks their body. An explosion is heard, and the camera goes dark.<BR>\
