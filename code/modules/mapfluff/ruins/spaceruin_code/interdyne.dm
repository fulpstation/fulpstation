	default_raw_text = "Welcome to your new life in the spinward frontier employee! As you may already know some of our current clients require products that don't exactly fall in line with current TerraGov regulations. As such you and many other of our best and bravest will continue our great work far from any prying eyes. Please remember that any and all mention of frontier work to non-employees will result in the immediate termination of your contracts."

	name = "The first note"
	default_raw_text = "Just got a new order in from headquarters today, sounds like Cybersun are twisting their arms to speed up the production of that new combat drug. Those damn execs don't know how hard it is to test dubious chemicals light years away from home."

/obj/item/paper/fluff/ruins/interdyne/note_2
	name = "The second note"
	default_raw_text = "Another failure, subject's heart exploded in record time. And it looks like our deadline's been shifted forward AGAIN, so we're gonna need to try something new if we're expected to show results. Micheal says some plasma samples are coming in soon, though I have my doubts that'll be of any use"

/obj/item/paper/fluff/ruins/interdyne/note_3
	name = "The third note"
	default_raw_text = "Something strange came in the last delivery, as expected one of the crates contained a store of plasma for us to make use of. But there was some kind of fungus growing on the edge of some of it. Before anyone could take a sample Jacob touched it with his bare hands, he's been getting steadily worse for wear for about a day now. Whatever this stuff is, its not safe...but it could be something to distract the higher ups with."

/obj/item/paper/fluff/ruins/interdyne/note_4
	name = "The fourth note"
	default_raw_text = "I was wrong. So, so wrong...Jacob succumbed to the fungal infection. And before we could contact headquarters to retrieve his body he rose up and bit two others like out of some kind of zombie movie. We're all barricaded in different rooms now but I don't know how long we can last with him out there...the others have started screaming and i've assumed the worst. I need to destroy the sample but Jacob is blocking the way to the vault, if anyone reads this. Inside the vault is a vial labeled R0-M3-ROL, destroy it. This can't be allowed to escape here..."

	name = "The final note"
	default_raw_text = "Sorry to dissapoint, but the sample's already ours. Don't worry, we'll put it to good use -The Tiger Cooperative"

	name = "God dammit Gary"
	default_raw_text = "This is the last time i'm gonna tell you this Gary, stop hogging all the pizza for yourself. Do you have any idea how expensive it is to ship those things out here? Keep it up and your rations are gonna be nothing but sugar pills for the next month."
