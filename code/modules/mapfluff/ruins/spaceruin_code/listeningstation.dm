/obj/item/paper/fluff/ruins/listeningstation/reports/march
	name = "march report"
	default_raw_text = {"Accepted new assignment from liaison at MI13. Mission: Report on all Nanotrasen activities in this sector.
	<br> Secondary Mission is to ensure survival of the person in the sleeper. This should not be hard, I have had personal experience with
	<br> this model of sleeper, and I know it to be of good quality.

/obj/item/paper/fluff/ruins/listeningstation/reports/april
	name = "april report"
	default_raw_text = {"A good start to the operation: intercepted Nanotrasen military communications. A convoy is scheduled to transfer nuclear warheads to a new military base.
	<br> This is as good a chance as any to get our hands on some heavy weaponry, I suggest we take it.
	<br> As far as base work goes, I have begun a refurnishing of the base using the supplies I received during my shipment. It takes the mind off for whenever the station goes... "dark".
	<br>
	<br> I suppose I shall await further commands.

/obj/item/paper/fluff/ruins/listeningstation/reports/may
	name = "may report"
	default_raw_text = {"Nothing of real interest to report this month. I have intercepted faint transmissions from what appears to be some sort of pirate radio station. They do not appear to be relevant to my assignment.
	<br> Using my connections, I was able to procure some signs and posters from Nanotrasen ships. I have a bundle of markers, so I spent today "disguising" the asteroid. Sloppy work, but I think it fits well.
	<br> It's a nice base, this. I have certainly served in worse conditions.
	<br> I have not heard anything about the mission on the new military base. I will press the matter later today.
	"}

/obj/item/paper/fluff/ruins/listeningstation/reports/june
	name = "june report"
	default_raw_text = {"Nanotrasen communications have been noticeably less frequent recently.  The pirate radio station I found last month has been transmitting pro-Nanotrasen propaganda. I will continue to monitor it.
	<br> While I pressed the matter on looting the nuclear warheads, they advised me that it was "above my paygrade". However, I slipped a bug I had lying around the satellite into the pockets of one of my
	<br> superiors into the coat pocket. They were saying it was useless without some sort of authentication device.
	<br>
	<br> It's not like anyone but me reads these, why else should I talk about my base upkeep? Today: the "lobby".

/obj/item/paper/fluff/ruins/listeningstation/reports/july
	name = "july report"
	default_raw_text = {"Hey, old guy got a transfer, and I was next in line. I'll show them how we do it over at the Gorlex Marauders! Let's monitor some stuff. This will be fun.
	<br> It seems "old guy" did some upkeep around the base, and I will admit: it's nice. The lobby is shoddy for some reason. Not sure why that is.
	<br> I read some of the older reports, and it seems like interesting stuff. No idea where June is. Ah well, maybe he got out in May?
	<br> Odd sleeper, the frost covered it up. They were telling me about this on the way here, that it's meant to be a replacement to ensure "seamless" operation of this base. Okay?
	<br> I have enough supplies to last me until November, and then I get picked up. Let's get this money!

/obj/item/paper/fluff/ruins/listeningstation/reports/august
	name = "august report"
	default_raw_text = {"holy shit i am so bored. does this even matter? i'm stranded here. they said they'd come for me after a few months and i have plenty of stores. i tried listening to station stuff... but-
	<br> ugh. i caught some chatter about some sort of disk, but i think it was cross-ference with ourselves? some gas station jingle came on, some feedback from... not even sure what that is
	<br> the "old guy" did a good job around this base. it's not finished in the lobby, but everything else is nice.
	<br> they expressly told me to <i>never</i> leave this post, but i think "old guy" didn't listen for putting up those signs. i did a lap around with a spacewalk, that was fun.
	<br> i'll stay tuned.
	"}

/obj/item/paper/fluff/ruins/listeningstation/reports/september
	name = "september report"
	default_raw_text = {"i'm... not doing good. i'm doing so bad. the sleeper is still there. my friend died in a sleeper malfunction. it overheated.
	<br> i don't want to unplug it, i don't want to wake them up. i don't go in the bedroom anymore, i have a small cot in the lobby area. i'm lonely.
	<br> blowing myself up is out of the question. it'll kill them too. i've killed many people in my life, but i think ending another that way
	<br> will probably send me to hell. if hell is anything like this, i'd rather try and salvage as much as i can before i pass. death awaits us all.
	<br>
	<br> i'm not even going to send this report off i just need to write. i've written a lot, but i burn it all. one a month stays.
	<br> walks are the only thing that help. i breathe and breathe in those until the oxygen runs out. it makes me feel alive, when every part of me is dead.

/obj/item/paper/fluff/ruins/listeningstation/reports/october
	name = "october report"
	default_raw_text = {"i am so fucking stupid. i ran out of tank oxygen, so i tried to jerry rig one of the auxiliary pressure tanks abroad the station to feed an eva tank.
	<br> as i have just learned, that was very stupid. the oxygen was below zero degrees, and it sprayed right into my open eyes. i can make out blobs of shapes and colors, but not much more.
	<br> i still know how to touch-type on this machine, it's second-nature to me. with the amount of painkillers i've used, my liver is also failing. i've had mood swings from the painkillers
	<br> so i've destroyed a lot of this base with my rage. it's unsustainable. there is not enough money in the world to keep me here any longer.
	<br> i've kept all of these reports on my person, the amount of times i've re-read them trying to think of "better" times gave it certain crinkles...
	<br> i know june from september from august just based on the wrinkles alone. i can't read them, but i know them more than i know myself these days.
	<br>
	<br> my only concern is the person in the sleeper. i'm not going to bother them with anything. if i woke them up, maybe i wouldn't be blind and i would be happy. i couldn't see that.
	<br> i fear they'll go insane reading these, so i'll make something up for november. i'll lie, effortfully lie. scatter the others, and this one. if you happen upon this note, i'm sorry. i ruined it for you.
	<br>
	<br> as soon as i find where i dropped my keycard, i'm going to use one last emergency oxygen tank, and float. if i am gunned for being a deserter, so be it. if i am shot by terragov or nanotrasen, so be it.
	<br> even if the pickup should come in a matter of weeks, i literally can not live with myself. a future in where i live in is completely unfeasible.
	<br> i will die among the stars.

	default_raw_text = {"Hey, hey, what's up loser! It's me, your predecessor! I had a radical stint here, and you will too! There's not much supplies left, but I'm certain you'll manage by the time the re-supply ship comes back!
	<br> I've made so much fucking dough just sitting on this ship and writing up reports, the content doesn't even matter! That's why I chose to use this one to shit on you! Look at your goofy face!
	<br> Got a bit of frostbite on your widdle-diddle face? Ha, ha ha, ha ha ha. Anyways, you've probably only got a month left, while I toughed it all out! I even left this place in a shitty condition
	<br> because I hated you so much! Fuck you! I'm off spending all of my dough, while you have to pick up the slack of my job! Anyways, don't get too bored now!
