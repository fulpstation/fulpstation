	What else am I supposed to say? Nanotrasen thinks these authentic cuirass models are too expensive for the simulation watchers.
	That's bullshit, but my hands are tied. But you know. If one of you cargo folk up at central command take a cuirass for yourself
	instead of throwing the damn thing out, like, I'm sure nobody would notice or care. OK, but I'm sitting here on an official
