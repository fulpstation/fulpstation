Future improvements:
	Better names/descriptions for ships/trading/planets
	More fluff lines for each site type.
	Adventure-Maker : styling aaaaah.
	Adventure-Maker : Consider parsing define hard-configured dm file for constants
	Typelists for event/site stuff to reduce costs
	Figure out some way to cache adventure prototypes / defer loading somehow so it scales better with a lot of adventure files.
	Unit test for json loading?
	Mk II drones with more tool slots/other buffs researchable at R&D ?
	Could use more scan conditions
	Exit Node - Random Node
